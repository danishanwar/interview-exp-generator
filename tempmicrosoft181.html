For example, if the input string is \xe2\x80\x9cGeeksforGeeks\xe2\x80\x9d, then output should be \xe2\x80\x98f\xe2\x80\x99 and if input string is \xe2\x80\x9cGeeksQuiz\xe2\x80\x9d, then output should be \xe2\x80\x98G\xe2\x80\x99.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-string-find-its-first-non-repeating-character/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-string-find-its-first-non-repeating-character/</a><p>This question was really easy to solve. Just simple implementation by using HashMap.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>3 marks: Given a number, find the next palindrome larger than the number.Number was in String format.<p>5 marks:\xc2\xa0Given a singly linked list L<sub>0</sub>\xc2\xa0-&gt; L<sub>1</sub>\xc2\xa0-&gt; \xe2\x80\xa6 -&gt; L<sub>n-1</sub>\xc2\xa0-&gt; L<sub>n</sub>.

We need to solve the problem given to us on paper using Brute force as well as optimised approach.<p><strong>Q1</strong>. Given an array A[] of n numbers and another number x, determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.<p><a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-that-given-a-set-a-of-n-numbers-and-another-number-x-determines-whether-or-not-there-exist-two-elements-in-s-whose-sum-is-exactly-x/">https://geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-that-given-a-set-a-of-n-numbers-and-another-number-x-determines-whether-or-not-there-exist-two-elements-in-s-whose-sum-is-exactly-x/</a><p><strong>Q2.\xc2\xa0</strong>The problem was to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a m X n matrix with the constraints that\xc2\xa0<em><strong>from each cell you can either move only to right or down</strong></em><span id="more-125069"></span><p><a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org/count-possible-paths-top-left-bottom-right-nxm-matrix/">https://geeksforgeeks.org/count-possible-paths-top-left-bottom-right-nxm-matrix/</a><div id="practiceLinkDiv"><strong>Tips to crack this round:</strong></div><p>1. Write well. Good handwriting matters to some extent.<br/>2. Write the approach first and comment your code well.<br/>3. At last write the time complexity and space complexity of the solution you wrote. All these really matters to an extent.<br/><strong>12</strong><strong> students were selected for the next round.</strong><p><strong>Round 3 (Technical Interview):\xc2\xa0</strong><p>This was a Face2Face round.<p>He first asked me to introduce myself and then asked me about my internship.Then he started asking me questions from Object Oriented Programming. The questions were:<p>Q. What do you know about virtual destructors? I answered it briefly . He was satisfied with my answer.<p>Q. What is Run time and Compile time polymorphism? Explain and give examples.<p>Q. What is method overloading ? What are the different ways to overload a method ?Write a piece of code for method overloading. Whether it supports run time or compile time polymorphism?<p>Q. Can a object of base call access the methods of child class that is overridden?<p>Then one coding question<p>Q. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-two-missing-numbers-set-1-an-interesting-linear-time-solution/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a set of 1000 natural nos. Out of which two nos are missing. Find those two nos</a>. He just wanted to know my approach.<p>Q. Then he asked me do you about linked list?Where you can use linked lists?<p>Q. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Swap two nos without using third variable as well as arithmetic operator</a>. It was a cake walk. It can be done using bitwise xor(^) operator.<p>First round went really well. They directly told me to go to HR Round.<p><strong>Round 4 (Technical cum HR) :</strong><p>He was senior most of all the interviewers. He asked me many questions about my schooling and what are the options i was getting after my 12th exam?<p>Then he asked about my internship and projects. He was very impressed with summer internship project.<p>Then he asked me about my projects related to android development. Then i showed him some of the apps made by me.He was very impressed with my apps.<p>Then he asked me to design a model which will keep track of the objects i.e. which objects are placed where in the home using voice enabled commands.<p>Then asked me how much time you will take develop an application for us? I answered Sir it will totally depend on what the app demands.<p>Then he told me let\xe2\x80\x99s build an app now.It was a game where there were two users . First user entered a word of four characters and submit . Then second user have to guess that word . He wanted to automate the process of guessing by the second user.I explained him my approach using <strong>HashMap and Prefix Matching</strong> . He was very much satisfied.<p>And then asked the common HR questions like Why Microsoft?What\xe2\x80\x99s your career objective? and all.<p>I was then asked to wait.<p><strong>Finally 5 students were selected and I was one among them. It really was the most amazing day of my life. &lt;3</strong><p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
