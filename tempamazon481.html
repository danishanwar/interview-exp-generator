MCQs were mostly logical reasoning, running time and DS/Algo. There were also 2-3 OS, 2-3 DBMS and 1 networking MCQ.<p>2 coding questions-<ol><li>Magic numbers are defined as either powers of 5, or sum of unique powers of 5. Find nth magic number. Eg: 5,25,30,125,130 etc.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/faithful-numbers/0">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Print matrix in diagonal form.<p><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-diagonally/0">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></p></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2: FTF Interview(Around 1 hr)</strong><br/>First the interviewer told me to introduce myself. After that he asked 2 coding questions.<ol><li>Given a binary tree and a node of that tree, find all nodes at a distance d from the given node. Pointer to root node is given.<br/>I took a lot of time to solve this question. The interviewer found mistakes and told me, and I corrected them or changed my approach slightly. After almost 45 minutes I was able to write the correct code.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nodes-at-given-distance-in-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Given an array of integers, find the first non-repeating number in the array.<br/>I gave him the hashmap based approach and he told me to write code. I did so. After that, he told me to find the answer in a single linear traversal of the array. I discussed a lot of approaches but none of them were satisfactory. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with the correct approach. (Later on when someone asked him the solution, he said that he himself doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know, but maybe a very complex solution exists. I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure on that. Maybe he just wanted to check how much we can think. :p)<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/non-repeating-element/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>&lt;Round 3: FTF Interview(Around 30 minutes)</strong><br/>The interviewer asked me what subjects I like. I told him ds algo but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear that. So he asked what else and I said DBMS. Then he asked me what is a transaction, how is it different from an sql query, what are its properties.<br/>After that he moved on to coding questions. He asked me what data structures or algos I like. I said arrays and graphs. Then he asked these questions.<ol><li>Given a sorted dictionary(array of words) of an alien language, find order of characters in that language. I told him I had seen this question before and told him the approach. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to write the code.<li>How will you find if a cycle exists in a directed graph?<br/>I gave him my approach and wrote the code.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Find the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string.<br/>I tried to solve and told him some approach, even though I knew it was wrong but was hoping for some hint. After just one or two minutes he said let me change the question.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-palindrome-in-a-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Given 3 characters a, b, c, find the number of strings of length n that can be formed from these 3 characters given that; we can use \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99 as many times as we want, \xe2\x80\x98b\xe2\x80\x99 maximum once, and \xe2\x80\x98c\xe2\x80\x99 maximum twice.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-of-strings-that-can-be-formed-using-a-b-and-c-under-given-constraints/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><br/>I told him the dynamic programming approach and he asked me to code it, so I wrote the code.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>After that he said that\xe2\x80\x99s all, do you want to ask any questions. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using <a href="http://www.contribute.geeksforgeeks.org">contribute.geeksforgeeks.org</a> or mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
