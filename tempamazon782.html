Around 350 students appeared in the online test. The duration was 90 minutes. It consisted of 20 MCQs based primarily on Predicting The Output, OS, CN and Data Structures.<p>These questions were pretty basic and easily solvable.<p>Apart from that, there were 2 coding questions.<p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a string, find the first element which is non -repetitive</a> i.e that element must not be present anywhere else in the string.<pre>  \r\n          Eg : Input : teeterson      \r\n               Output : r, as it is the first element which \r\n                        is non repetitive. </pre><p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-permutation/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a string of digits,find the next smallest number using the same digits.</a>If its not possible to get such a number print -1;<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><pre>     \r\n        Eg : Input : "123"  Output : "132"\r\n             Input : "12453" Output : "123534"\r\n             Input : "987"     Output :  "-1" </pre><p>After a week, the results came out and 25 students were shortlisted.<p><strong>Personal Interviews:</strong><p><strong>Technical Interview 1 :</strong><p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-the-zeros/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of 1s followed by 0s,find the number of 0s</a>.<pre>  \r\n     Eg : Input : 111100    Output =2\r\n          Input : 1         Output =0 </pre><p>I solved it by using Binary Search to find the first and last occurrence of 0 in the array and subtracting the results.<p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/two-numbers-with-sum-closest-to-zero/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find the pair of elements whose sum is closest to 0.</a><pre>   \r\n     Eg : Input :  3 5 -9 -4 17 11       \r\n          Output  3 , -4  </pre><p>The brute force solution would be O(n^2) by comparing each pair of elements.As expected, he asked me to optimize my solution.<br/>So I sorted the array using merge sort. (I know its not in-place but it did not strike me at the time)<br/>Then used two indexes at the beginning and end of the the array and incremented/decremented the indexes as needed.<p>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/root-to-leaf-paths/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a Binary Tree , print all the root to leaf paths.</a><p>I started by telling him my approach and the logic behind the recursive solution that I had in mind. Then he asked me to write test cases for the function that I had written.<p>6 students were selected after this round.<p><strong>Technical Interview 2</strong><p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-tree-to-dll/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a binary tree convert it to a double linked list.</a><br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/product-array-puzzle/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of integers , replace each element with the product of the remaining elements</a>.<pre>\r\n  Eg : Input - 1 2 3 4     \r\n       Output : 24 12 8 6 </pre><p>First, i gave the obvious solution. I computed the product of the whole array and then divided it by each element to get the resultant array.<p>But he asked me to do it without using the division operation. After some cross questioning I gave the following solution.<br/>Store the product of the left side elements for each integer in an array L[].<pre>\r\nFor eg : Here , L[]= {1 , 1 , 2 , 6 }\r\n\r\nDo the same for the right side elements.\r\n\r\nHere R[] = { 24 , 12 , 4 , 1} \r\n\r\nThe multiply R[i] and L[i]  to get the resultant array.\r\nComplexity : O(n) </pre><p>Finally 2 people were selected.<br/>Result: Selected for a 6 month long internship as SDE-T (Testing)<p>GeeksForGeeks has been instrumental in my preparation for the interviews and I am really glad that I discovered this website at the right time.<p>PS : Could you guys tell me if the SDE-T position is inferior to the SDE-1 position or are they of the same level?<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
