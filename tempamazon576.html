First was written programming test and we needed to write full working code without a single bug. Guys please focus more on written, sometimes we don\xe2\x80\x99t take this serious and write code with many bugs.<p><strong>Written Round:</strong><br/>Write most optimized solution for all problem.<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-linked-list-is-pallindrome/1">Check a linked list is palindrome or not.</a><br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0">Search an element in a row and column wise sorted matrix.</a><br/>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/bit-difference/0">Number of bits we need to flip from A to get B.</a><p>Problems are easy and can be solved if you have practiced for sometime from geeksforgeeks but the major part was writing clean and bug free code with most optimized solutions.<br/><strong><br/>F2F \xe2\x80\x93 1</strong><br/>After clearing the written round I went for first F2F round.<br/>1. There is one class which has private array list and this array list is initialized in constructor of this class.<br/>We have one public method getItem(int i) { \xe2\x80\x9d return ith item of array list\xe2\x80\x9d }, We need to know the size of array list. We can only call getItem method.<br/><a href="https://ideone.com/VaE0QL">https://ideone.com/VaE0QL</a><br/>Please check the above code for more details.<p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/insert-a-node-in-a-bst/1">Search an element in a BST</a>.<p>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-intervals/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a set of time intervals in any order, Print all the pair of overlapping intervals .</a><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>4. My college project was on RTOS (Real Time OS) and interviewer also did the same project when he was in college , so we had lot of discussion on project.<p>He was very impressed.<br/><strong><br/>F2F-2</strong><br/>Here is F2F round 2 where I was not able to give optimized approach for the first problem.<br/>1. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/suffix-tree-application-3-longest-repeated-substring/">Given a string and he asked me to find Longest Repeated Substring in the given string.</a><p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-all-possible-paths-from-top-left-to-bottom-right/0">Given a mXn matrix with no obstacle and we can move in right or down direction. Count the no of paths to reach from top left cell to bottom right</a>.<br/>I gave recursive solution with 2^n complexity and then optimized the solution using memoization.<p>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/unique-partitions/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Create sorted list of all unique partitions of given number 5 = { {4, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 1, 1} \xe2\x80\xa6. }</a><p>This round didn\xe2\x80\x99t go well and I was praying L Finally HR came and said you haven\xe2\x80\x99t performed well in this round so you will have another technical round and I was like \xe2\x80\x9cok no problem\xe2\x80\x9d.<br/><strong><br/>F2F \xe2\x80\x93 3</strong><br/>Finally last round of the day and I knew I have to perform well otherwise I have no chance.<p>1. You are given a dictionary and a string. You need to check the string is valid (exist in given dictionary) or not, if its not valid then perform one of the three operation (Insert , remove , replace) on string and get a valid string. We need to find another string which has One edit distance with this string.<br/>Interviewer asked me about the data structure used to implement the Dictionary. I suggested Trie for dictionary. After some discussion he asked me to write code for insert in Trie and for the above problem.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/edit-distance/0">Edit Distance</a><p>2. How to implement Trie. Space optimized version.<br/>This was part of 1st problem and we had discussion on space of a trie when we have 500-600 characters in some language. I suggested HashMap instead of using static array in Trie. And then he asked me to write structure and Insert method.<p>3.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/transform-to-sum-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Max sum tree . every node has its value plus maximum of left and right sub tree sum.</a><br/>Expected time complexity O(N).<br/>After this round HR told me to leave for the day and I will have one more technical and one Hiring manager round.<br/>I was happy that I completed all the round.<p>4. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-sum-rectangle/0">Find maximum sum rectangle in given matrix.</a><br/><strong><br/>F2F \xe2\x80\x93 4 (Technical plus behavioural)</strong><br/>1. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-element-in-an-array-which-is-first-increasing-and-then-decreasing/">Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing.</a><br/>2. Project discussions.<br/>3. Anything that you have done out of your responsibility.( In technical part )<br/>4. Any situation when your manager really appreciated your work.<br/><strong><br/>Telephonic Round with hiring manager.</strong><br/>This was my last round of the process and it was with hiring manager.<br/>1. Tell me about yourself.<br/>2. Your day to day work at current company.<br/>3. Discuss any project which.<br/>4. Any disagreement movement with your manager.<br/>5. Why Amazon? and why are you leaving current company?<br/>Guys prepare hard for behavioural questions, these questions are asked to know the person.<br/>Then 2 easy programming questions but again the measuring part was code and the way we explain our solution.<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/palindrome-string/0">Check a string is palindrome or not.</a><br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-number-of-words/0">Count no of words in a string.</a><br/>He asked me to write test case for both the problem.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
