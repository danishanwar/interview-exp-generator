Aptitude and Logical Reasoning (20 Questions)<p>2. General Programming \xc2\xa0(20 Questions)<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>3. CS Core Subjects Concepts \xc2\xa0(20 Questions)<p>We were provided 30 minutes for solving each section.<p>First section consists of basic mathematical and logical reasoning questions on topics like speed and distance,permutation,Mixtures,etc. This was a quite easy section.<p>Second section consists of the general programming questions which were mainly from C language and Object Oriented Programming. This section also had some code output and error detection questions.One has to be very thorough with the basic C programming concepts like Pointers,Storage Classes,etc.Some questions were also from Number System Conversion(like convert a given number from binary number to hexadecimal number).<p>Third section mainly consists of the MCQ questions based on CS Core subjects like Operating Systems,Computer Networks,OOPs .This section also consists of some code output and error detection questions.<p>Tips :- Solve the questions with calm mind. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stress yourself during test. Don\xe2\x80\x99t spend too much time on any question if you are not able to do it in the first attempt.<p><strong>Round 2: F2F Interview</strong><p>In this round , she asked me small questions which include:<p>1.Tell me about Yourself<p>Suggestion:Mention the things in the Introduction at which you are good.<p>2.Describe your project and comparison based \xc2\xa0questions related to the technologies i used in my project.(Like why you used MongoDB and its alternatives.)<p>3.Why do you want to join Our Organisation and what do you know about our company?<p>Suggestion:Please Read a little bit about the company and its current projects before giving the interview.<p>4.What are your Strengths?<p>5.Have you ever used your strength in solving some problem in the past?<p>6.What is Binary Search Tree?<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/</a><p>7.Give an Algorithm to determine that whether a Binary Tree is Binary Search Tree or not.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/</a><p>8.What is Doubly Linked List and where it is used in real world?<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/doubly-linked-list/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/doubly-linked-list/</a><p>9.What is Stack?<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/</a><p>10.What is Hashing?<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-data-structure/#:~:text=Hashing%20is%20an%20important%20Data,of%20the%20hash%20function%20used.">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-data-structure/#:~:text=Hashing%20is%20an%20important%20Data,of%20the%20hash%20function%20used.</a><p>11.Which one would be better between Hash Table and Queue.<p>12.What is Graph?<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/</a><p>13.What is OOPs?<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/</a><p>14.Features of OOPs.<p>15.Describe two of the features of the OOPs with real life example.<p>Then some aptitude puzzle were asked.<p>16.Reverse a given array in-place.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/</a><p>So this was all about my F2F Interview.<p><strong>Round 3: HR Round</strong><p>HR simply asked that why i would like to join their organisation and what are my key area of interest.<p>Then he brief me about my intern role.<p>Hurray!
