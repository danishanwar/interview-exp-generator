I used a queue to solve the problem. He was very much satisfied with my code. so, he asked me a simple question next.<li>Given an array and the number. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-that-given-a-set-a-of-n-numbers-and-another-number-x-determines-whether-or-not-there-exist-two-elements-in-s-whose-sum-is-exactly-x/">Find two elements whose sum is equal to the given number</a>. First I said\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>O</em>(<em>N<sup>2</sup></em>) solution. He asked me to optimize. Then I said to use the hashmap. He was satisfied and asked me to write the code. He asked how hashmap is implemented and what is the process inside it.<li>He asked for my favourite language. Then he asked me questions about<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-c/"> polymorphism</a> and how it is implemented.</li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>It was technical cum HR interview.<ul><li>He started the interview by asking HR questions like Why Microsoft should select you?<li>Why are you better than other people?

He was impressed.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>Firstly I have to tell all my previous problem then he gave me the problem similar to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-7-coin-change/">coin exchange problem</a>.<br/>Then some questions are asked about Where do you grow? In which field do you want yourself to grow?
