The interview started without any formalities. I was given a live code link. The panel consisted of 2-3 individuals joining in and out, but only one of them was interacting with me. Two easy questions were asked during the interview.<p><strong>Question 1: </strong>An apparently tricky question that could be solved greedily.<p><strong>Question 2: </strong>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/. The interviewer further asked if this could be done by using constant extra space.<p>The interviewer asked if I had any questions. I asked questions like how algorithms are used in the field they\xe2\x80\x99re working and what teams do what kind of tasks.<p>Finally, 13 people, including me, were selected out of 41 shortlisted students.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
