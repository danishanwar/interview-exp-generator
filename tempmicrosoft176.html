Process consisted of following rounds. each round was an elimination round. we started off with about 200 applicants and in the end 10 were selected.<p><strong>Round 1:\xc2\xa0</strong><p>First round was an online test on Co-Cubes that comprised of three coding questions.

Alithough it was a written round, but i would advise to try and interact with interviewer and discuss approach.<p>Question 1: Given an equation print its reverse. Ex. I/P=\xc2\xa0 66 + 23 * 45 +77/330 ; O/P=\xc2\xa0 330/77+ 45 * 23 + 66\xc2\xa0.<p>this is similar to -&gt; <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/</a>\xc2\xa0 the only difference is to also reverse words when operators are encountered.<p>Question 2:\xc2\xa0<a href="http://www.zrzahid.com/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/">http://www.zrzahid.com/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/</a><p>The key to clear this round is to write code and explain it\xe2\x80\x99s approach very clearly . They need to see your problem solving skills and how you try to approach it. Reaching right answer is not that important.<p><strong>Round 3, 4, 5 : Personal Interview (60-75 Minutes each)</strong><p>Group fly was followed by 3 personal interviews. Each was an elimination round . In each round first my resume was discussed. It is important that you know your projects in and out.<p>Then interviewer gave me a simple question :<p>1)<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-characters-string-no-two-adjacent/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-characters-string-no-two-adjacent/</a><p>2)<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence/</a><p>3)<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-12-longest-palindromic-subsequence/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-12-longest-palindromic-subsequence/</a><p>4)<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/</a><p>5)How does square root library work ? Implement it.<p>I was also asked some questions from OS. Process, threads and paging were asked.<p>First we discussed approach and then he asked me to code. It is important that you keep discussing your approach while thinking about it. Be confident . Walk interviewer through each line of code. First try to give naive and brute force solution . Do not try to jump and give the most optimized solution right away. They need to see your problem solving skills. The interviewer will try to break your code by test cases. But they will also suggest solutions here and there. They are also very friendly so environment is relaxed.<p><strong>Round 6 : Personal Interview \xe2\x80\x93 HR (60-75 Minutes)</strong><p>This was the final round with a senior interviewer he asked me about myself and why I wanted to work with them.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using contribute.geeksforgeeks.org or mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
