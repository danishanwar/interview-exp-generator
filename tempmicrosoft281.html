Total 65 students were eligible. 15 MCQs were asked-<br/>Everyone had different sets. All sorts of questions were asked, I had each question on linked lists, binary tree, B tree, STL, sorting, Java and OS.<p><strong>Second round- Coding.</strong><br/>Around 40 students were shortlisted and coding round was conducted the same day. Everyone had different questions. Two problems were given and I had-<br/>1. Find max index difference j-i such that a[j]&gt;a[i] and j&gt;i.<br/>2. Find sum of data of all leaves of a binary tree on same level and then multiply sums obtained of all levels.<br/>People who solved both and some with one were shortlisted. Results were announced after 3 weeks.<br/>14 people were shortlisted after second round and were called to Bangalore.<br/>Many students from different colleges were present for process there.<p><strong>Third round- Group fly.</strong><br/>This was elimination round. Two questions were to be solved in one hour. A mentor was assigned to each group of 8-9 students. We had to discuss our approach and then code it and submit.<br/>1. Remove duplicates from string in place in O(n).<br/>2. Check whether given binary tree is balanced or not. Definition was no two leaves should have height difference of greater than one.<br/>People who solved both or at least gave proper approach for both were shortlisted.<p><strong>Fourth round \xe2\x80\x93 Technical interview (45 min to 1 hour)</strong><br/>Interviewer was polite and responsive.<p>First 15 min discussion on my database project, he asked me questions like what technologies I used for front end and back end. I explained all the functionalities.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Then he asked me a question on binary tree.<br/>Connect nodes on same level in a binary tree. Initially I gave him level order approach where I used recursive function to access each level but as it was O(n^2) he told me to optimize the solution.<br/>Then I gave him iterative approach of following-<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level-with-o1-extra-space/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level-with-o1-extra-space/</a><br/>He said the code will be complex and there will be many cases, so he told me to think of another approach. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to give another approach other than these.<p><strong>Final round was HR</strong> but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t called for it.<p>Overall experience was good and mentors, interviewers were very polite.<p>Thanks to geeksforgeeks team for putting such good content on website.
