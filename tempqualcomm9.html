Was conducted which consists of 3 sections as follows.<ol><li>Aptitude<li>Programming Question(Input / output related question)<li>Theory including data structure, operating system, algorithms, etc.</li></li></li></ol><p>There was a sectional cut off for each section. No coding question.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 2(Interview): </strong>The whole Interview process was carried out virtually at Microsoft Team Meeting. It is a one-day process consist of 2 technical Rounds and 1 HR round. Each Round proceeds are dependent on the previous round interview.<p>In 1st technical round, some basic question was asked and in the second technical round, the in-depth question was asked. Below is the topic wise question asked during all the 3 round<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Basic Question:</strong><ol><li>Introduce yourself and education-related question<li>About Project in details Mention in the resume<li>Something exciting Work did not mention in my resume.<li>Why join Qualcomm instead of Samsung(I already had a Samsung Noida offer on Campus).</li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Coding:</strong><ol><li>Program to clear the kth Bit (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-clear-k-th-bit-of-a-number-n/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-clear-k-th-bit-of-a-number-n/</a>)<li>Implement min () or max () function using bitwise OR (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compute-the-minimum-or-maximum-max-of-two-integers-without-branching/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compute-the-minimum-or-maximum-max-of-two-integers-without-branching/</a>)<li>Write your own size of function (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-sizeof/</a>)<li>Finding Loop in the Linked List. (<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1</a>)<li>Write a function to calculate an average and after that, he provides some constraint and modifies the question\xe2\x80\xa6 (Did not remember that part).<li>One and two more coding questions asked did not remember the question.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Puzzle:</strong><ol><li>Racing Horse puzzle. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-9-find-the-fastest-3-horses/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-9-find-the-fastest-3-horses/</a>)<li>Apple / Orange Basket Puzzle. (https://www.ritambhara.in/3-basket-puzzle-appleorange-puzzle/)<li>One more puzzle asked but did not remember.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Theory Question on Operating System:</strong><ol><li>What is re-entrant?<li>Deadlock Condition and how to avoid it?<li>Mutex and Semaphores (theory and real-life example too).<li>Process State, Scheduler etc.<li>Cache Related Question (Computer Organization).<li>Fragmentation (Internal and, External Both).<li>Memory management.<li>Kernel, thread related question.<li>More on operating question-related question was asked not to remember exactly.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Theory Question on Programming:</strong><ol><li>Memory Layout (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/</a>)<li>Enum, Micro related question<li>Storage class in C and C++<li>Malloc, realloc, calloc related question<li>Pointer declaration related question like how given pointer declare is read out like int * a[9]; or int (*a[9]);(<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointer-array-array-pointer/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointer-array-array-pointer/</a>) and more question related to pointer<li>Function declaration, calling, recursion, pass by value, pass by reference, etc.<li>OOPs concept full theory plus real-life example.<li>Compiler related question like full phases of a written program. Like conversation of c.obj file-&gt; C.exe file etc. The symbol table, loader, linker, etc. (refer Ravula compiler lecture video)(<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-compiler-design/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-compiler-design/</a>)</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>My Suggestion for preparation: </strong>Gate preparation will make the theory related question easy and in online test generally gate related question was asked. For coding, you must solve company-wise asked questions. One piece of advice to include in your resume for which you have in-depth knowledge(lesson learned from a Microsoft Interview). Further, try to focus on the brute force method first instead of directly giving an efficient solution during the interview.<p>Forgive me if my English is not good. By the way, I selected QUALCOMM Hyderabad over Samsung Noida. \xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
