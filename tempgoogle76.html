The interview process took around 5 months for completion as they provide you ample amount of time to prepare for your interviews so when you appear for the interview you are in your best form.<p><strong>HR Round:</strong> Google was first company where HR herself took a small rapid-fire round to test if the candidate is even worthy for scheduling a telephonic screening with one of the Google engineer.<br/>Few questions:<ol><li>Worst time complexity for Heap sort?<li>Merge sort is better or Heap sort? And why?<li>Does Quicksort complexity depends on what pivot element we choose like middle one, rightmost one or leftmost one?<li>What is the value of 2^24? (Here HR wanted to check how would I approach this calculation provided I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calculator with me.)</li></li></li></li></ol><p>The round was easy for someone who is preparing for Google but it might come as a surprise for some who are not expecting this and might end up giving wrong answers.<p><strong>Telephonic Round:\xc2\xa0</strong>This round went for exactly 45 mins. The interviewer went straight for the question. In this round it is crucial that you manage the time, code readability &amp; obviously the correctness of the solution that you provide. Moreover you have to code on Google Docs so indenting the code is important for maintaining clean code.<p>Question: You are given 2 strings which are exactly same but 1 string has an extra character. Find that character.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Approach: Sort the strings and keep matching until you find that extra character because it won\xe2\x80\x99t be present in other string. Time Complexity \xe2\x80\x93 O(nlogn).<p>He asked me to code the solution. After this he asked me to further optimise it without sorting the strings.<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
