We had a total of 3 rounds <strong>(1 Online Coding on Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s Assessment Portal + 2 Technical Interviews).</strong><p>Here is my interview experience for the same.<p><strong>Round 1(Online Coding Round): </strong>This round was conducted on Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s own Assessment platform, There were MCQs on Aptitude, Basic Programming, CS fundamentals, English Comprehension, and Decision Making along with 2 coding questions of easy/medium difficulty.<ul><li>Suggestion for MCQs: Have a sound Knowledge of CS Fundamentals and Aptitude Solving Practice.<li>Coding Questions were based on Implementation only.<li>Good practice on Implementation based problems involving <i><strong>Maps, Vectors, Sets, and other C++ STL components is a must</strong></i>.</li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 2(Technical Interview 1): </strong>The platform<i> for </i>the <i>Interview<strong> </strong>was<strong> Amazon Chime</strong></i><p>The Interviewer asked only 2 Coding Questions in this round:<ol><li>The first problem was, <i><strong>Given an array of size n having n elements and another array of size n+m having m elements, Sort these two arrays and store the final result in the second array, which should contain the elements of both the arrays.</strong></i><ul><li>First I suggested a Brute Force solution by using a third array and then sort them and put them back in the Second array.<li>After that, I suggested a better solution without using a third array, by comparing elements from starting of the first array to the elements at the starting of the second array.<li>After that, he said you are close and then gave me a hint, and I was able to solve the problem successfully.<li>After that, I was asked to code the solution for this problem, which I did as well.<li>And then I was asked to determine the <i><strong>Time and Space Complexity</strong></i> of my code.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><li>The Second Problem was, <i><strong>Given a Binary Search Tree, Convert it into a Sorted Doubly Linked List and return the Head Pointer</strong></i>.<ul><li>This was a <i><strong>Standard Problem of BST</strong></i>.<li>I explained my <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-given-binary-tree-doubly-linked-list-set-3/"><i><strong>Approach</strong></i></a> by Traversing from the right to left in the Tree to get the Sorted order of the Linked List.<li>And then I wrote the code for My solution.<li>The interviewer was satisfied with my Code and then asked me to determine the <i><strong>Time and Space Complexity</strong></i> of my code.</li></li></li></li></ul></li></li></ol><p>After this, he asked if I had any questions for him. This round lasted for about 60 Minutes.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 3 (Technical Interview 2): </strong>The platform for the Interview was <i><strong>Amazon Chime</strong></i><p>The Interviewer asked 2 Coding Questions and some Behavioural Questions in this round :<ol><li>The first problem was,<i><strong> Find the first 100 Prime Numbers.</strong></i><ul><li>For this Problem first, I suggested a Brute Force Approach by checking numbers starting from 2 whether they are Prime or Not, till we get 100 Prime Numbers.<li>After that, I suggested a better approach, which is using the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/"><i><strong>Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm</strong></i></a>.<li>He was satisfied with my Approach, after that he made me code the Solution.<li>After that, he asked me the<i><strong> Time and Space Complexity</strong></i> of my Code.</li></li></li></li></ul><li>The second problem was, <strong>Given an array of Strings, find which strings can be combined with other strings in the array so as to make the strings that are present in the array.</strong><ul><li>For this Problem, First, I suggested a Brute Force Approach using Maps.<li>After that, he asked me for a better approach.<li>After Thinking a while, <i><strong>I figured out another Approach using Trie</strong></i>.<li>He asked me to explain the <i><strong>Concept of </strong></i><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/"><i><strong>Trie Data Structure</strong></i> </a>and why do we use it.<li>After that he asked me to code the solution using Trie.<li>After I completed the code, he asked me the <i><strong>Time and Space Complexity</strong></i> of my Code.<li>I was, to give the proper logic and explain my approach to him and he was satisfied with my Solution.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul></li></li></ol><p>After this, he asked me some <i><strong>Behavioural Questions which are the Important Part of all the Amazon Interviews</strong></i>. Fortunately, I had already prepared for some of the Most asked Behavioural Questions by Amazon. The behavioral questions were,<ol><li><i><strong>What is the most innovative thing you have done?</strong></i><li><i><strong>When is the time when you tried something unique, Did you failed or succeed?</strong></i></li></li></ol><p>After this, he asked if I had any questions for him. This round lasted for about 65 Minutes.<p>After around 1.5 Weeks, the Result was declared and<i><strong> I was selected for the role of Software Development Engineer (6-Months Internship + PPO).</strong></i><p><strong>My suggestion for the Interviews :</strong><ol><li>Practice all the<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?company%5B%5D=Amazon&amp;page=1&amp;company%5B%5D=Amazon"><i><strong> Standard Amazon problems from GfG</strong></i>.</a><li>Have a good understanding of the CS Fundamentals in OS, DBMS, CN, and OOPS.<li>Prepare some<i><strong> short notes on CS fundamentals and DSA Problems</strong></i>, which will we useful for last-minute revision.<li>Prepare and notes down answers to some<i><strong> </strong></i><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><i><strong>Standard Amazon Behavioural round questions</strong></i></a><i><strong> </strong></i>:<ul><li>Tell me about Yourself.<li>What are your Strengths and Weaknesses.<li>Tell me about a hard situation for you, and how did you overcome it.<li>Tell me about a time when you took a risk and failed.<li>Why should we hire you.</li></li></li></li></li></ul></li></li></li></li></ol><p><i><strong>At last, always keep calm while giving the Interviews for positive results.</strong></i><p><i><strong>All the best for your Interviews.</strong></i><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
