Problem solving skills i.e.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/"> algorithm</a><br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/">Coding skills</a><br/>3. Knowledge of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/">DS</a><p><strong>Round 1:</strong><p>The round 1 consisted of 20 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quizzes-on-programming-languages-gq/">MC Quizzes</a> which are of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/">GATE level</a> and two coding questions.<p>As far as I remember the first coding question\xe2\x80\x99s logic was to <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/magic-numbers/0">find GCD of an array of number</a> which I solved using recursive approach.<p>I cleared the round 1.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>It was a F2F round where 3 members were assigned to a particular member. They gave us 2 questions and write the pseudo code for them in 1 hour during which we also can interact with them.<p>I asked them where I had doubt and after I say logic to him he asked me that if I can optimize it, explain the code so on.<p>As I gave him all the optimisations he asked algorithmically , I was not able to write a clean code because of lack of time.<p>I selected as 8th candidate.<p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>This was also a F2F round and it is one to one. Where his first question was that why did I not write any code in previous round and then asked \xe2\x80\x9d Tell me about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d<p>Then he shooted me with coding questions. His first question was a popular question(which I came to know later) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/trapping-rain-water/0">rainwater problem</a>, and the next one was <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-traversal-in-spiral-form/">printing the nodes of a binary tree in zig Zag manner</a>.<p>Then he asked me some questions from OS i.e. internal fragmentation vs external fragmentation to which I replied \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the topic but please let me try\xe2\x80\x9d then I got correct answer to one question and wrong to second one. Then he asked about process life cycle.<p>Then he asked that if I have any questions and then he asked \xe2\x80\x9d why Amazon?\xe2\x80\x9d That was it.<p>We were said to wait and luckily \xc2\xa0I was selected.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using\xc2\xa0<a href="http://www.contribute.geeksforgeeks.org/">contribute.geeksforgeeks.org</a>\xc2\xa0or mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
