We had a total of 3 rounds (1 Online Coding on Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s Assessment Portal + 2 Technical Interviews).\xc2\xa0<p>Online test was given by around 1000 students.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 1(Online Test): </strong>The first round comprised of 4 sections online questions including aptitude, logical, Coding questions, and technical portions (Test Duration: 90 mins):<ul><li>Debugging: We had to choose a language and debug up to 7 questions most probably. Codes were very basic like sorting, etc. I completed 6 of them.<li>Coding: There were two medium-hard level questions.<li>Work-style Assessment: Just try to answer as an ideal employee. Make sure you answers don\xe2\x80\x99t contradict each other.<li>Aptitude: Around 25 questions.</li></li></li></li></ul><p>Only 118 students were selected for the next round.<p><strong>Round 2(Technical Interview 1): </strong>Round was on Amazon Chime(Test Duration: 75 min)<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diameter-of-a-binary-tree/">Find diameter of the tree</a>: I answered it, we discussed edge cases and I coded it. I think he found out that I have already done it before so then he asked to do it instead of when its not necessary to end the path at leaf nodes. It was a simple change so I did that as well.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-inversions/">Count Inversion</a>: I was struggling to come up with a solution, so he told me to think about sort algorithms. I did and got it right eventually. I coded it and we were good to go.</li></li></ol><p>He was constantly asking me to speak out my thoughts. It is very important so that interviewer can understand your problem-solving skills and help you wherever needed.<p>Not sure how many were selected because they got informed privately, I think the number can be around 30 to 50.<p><strong>Round 3(Technical Interview 2): </strong>It happened the next day. It was also on Amazon Chime(Test Duration: 65 min)<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/">Find n\xe2\x80\x99th node from the end of a Linked List</a>: I answered using 2 traversals. Then he asked to do it in single traversal. After some time I got it. We discussed edge cases and I coded it.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-distance-two-cells-matrix-grid/">Find shortest distance between 2 points in a matrix, where 2 points can be anywhere</a>: I gave recursion as an approach, he asked me to give time complexity, which I told O(4^(m+n)) \xc2\xa0but I think it was wrong. Then he asked me to optimize it, and I gave him DP solution. He asked how I was sure about it, I told that it follows optimal sub-structure and overlapping sub-problems, he seemed convinced. Time was running out so he told me quickly code it but\xe2\x80\xa6<li>In between he told me to stop and asked me about projects. I told him about my Instagram Clone made in Django, so he asked why Django. I told him the reasons. Then he asked whether I have any questions, I went blank and so I asked a stupid question about meaning of 6M Intern which he answered and we were good to go.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Tips:</strong><ul><li>Amazon just want to see whether you have good problem-solving skills. If you show them, you are in.<li>Do DSA religiously from the beginning. Use GFG, Leetcode, InterviewBit, and Youtube. These are more than enough. Doing Competitive Programing is very helpful.<li><strong>For frequently asked questions</strong>: Make sure you know the best approaches and edge cases, and write the whole code instead of just reading the solutions.<li>Start from brute force and keep on optimizing when asked, in order to show you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already done the question before.<li>Speak while coding or thinking.<li>Repeat the question how you have understood it.<li>Find edge cases<li>Use STAR method for behavioral questions.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Result came out after 10 days. 13 students were selected. 2 were from my college. I was one of them ; )<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
