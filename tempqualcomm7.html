Today I\xe2\x80\x99m going to share Qualcomm interview experience for the role of Software Engineer. I hope it\xe2\x80\x99ll surely help you to prepare well for the next interview. So without further ado let\xe2\x80\x99s get started.<p><strong>Job Application</strong>:- I applied for the role of Software Engineer at Qualcomm through Glassdoor. I got a hackerrank invite to take the online assessment. \xc2\xa0<p><strong>Online Assessment:- </strong>There were basically two sections in the assessment. The first section contained MCQs and the second section contained two coding questions.\xc2\xa0<p><u>The First Section</u><p>MCQs were totally based on C#, ASP.NET, Angular JS, and OOPs concepts.\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>All the questions in this section contained code snippets and asked to guess the output.<p><u>The Second Section</u><p>It contained two coding questions. The first one was based on the Left View of the Binary Tree and the second question was purely based on the heap sort algorithm. The question was like remove two minimum elements from the array and add the sum of the removed elements to the array. Repeat this step until the length of the array is 1. It asked to find the total cost incurred in all the operations.\xc2\xa0<p><strong><u>Round 1: </u></strong>In this round, the questions were totally based on Python and Unix commands only<p>The round was held in Hackerrank code editor where the interviewer gave some problems to solve particularly in Python from topics like python decorator, lambda function, map, reduce and filter.\xc2\xa0<p>I could specifically remember a question from this round<ol><li>#!/usr/bin/env python \xe2\x80\x93&gt; Why it is needed and what does this mean?<li>On Unix, the interviewer asked about the functionalities of some commands.</li></li></ol><p><strong><u>Round 2: </u></strong>In this round, there were three coding problems given to solve on a virtual whiteboard like that of windows notepad.\xc2\xa0<ol><li>The first question was based on the Top View of the Binary tree. (<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/top-view-of-binary-tree/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/top-view-of-binary-tree/1</a>)<li>The second question was based on Dutch National Flag problem. (<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s4231/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s4231/1</a>)<li>The third question was based on checking whether a string t is left rotation of another string S or not. (<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-strings-are-rotations-of-each-other-or-not-1587115620/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-strings-are-rotations-of-each-other-or-not-1587115620/1</a>)</li></li></li></ol><p><strong><u>Round 3: </u></strong>In this round, the interviewer asked me questions on a previous company project that I worked in, about personal projects. It was majorly a discussion based on the resume.\xc2\xa0<p>After this round, I got rejected. So guys don\xe2\x80\x99t lose hope and keep learning and keep practicing.\xc2\xa0<p>Thanks.\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
