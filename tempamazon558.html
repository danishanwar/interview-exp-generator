I answered trees and linked list.<br/>So, the questions were from the basics of trees.<br/>Q1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-for-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Check if a given binary tree is a Binary Search Tree.</a><br/>Then questions stemmed out from the in-order successor part and the in-order successor had to be coded with and without using the parent pointer.<br/>Q2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/stack-using-two-queues/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Implement Stack using Arrays Linked Lists and Queues.</a> And comment on their advantages and disadvantages.<br/>Q3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/queue-using-two-stacks/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Implement Queues using Stacks </a>and comment on the complexity.<p>Questions were simple enough but code was required.<p>20 people out of 31 were selected.<p><strong><br/>The Third Round : F2F Interview 2</strong><p>A different interviewer in the same setting.<br/>Found the questions to be of higher standard compared to the previous round and more time consuming.<p>Q1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Maintain the First Non-Repeating character in a stream of incoming and out going characters or digits </a>simply in O(1).<br/>Gave some solutions for O(n) at a particular instant of time.<br/>But used a Hash and Queue but that did not allow maintaining the first non-repeating character as the elements could not be accessed randomly.<br/>There were a lot of hints and finally i understood that the interviewer was hinting at a deque where the hash value is the node pointer in deque.<br/>I just had to sum up the small things and give a final solution with all the bits and pieces arranged.<br/>Not Very Satisfactory.<p>Q2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/clone-a-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cloning of a Binary tree with random pointer:</a><br/>Did the cloning of the normal binary tree but could not do it for the random pointers because I need the links and paths.<br/>Gave a O(nlogn) solution storing all the paths from the node to its random pointer node.<br/>Finally, I came up with a Hash Map Solution which seemed fine.<br/>The interviewer told me to practice more qustions and increase the depth of knowledge in Data Structures.<p>This was all for the interview!<br/>Though the questions were not common for me, these are standard questions and can be found in gfg.<br/>But somehow I kept thinking and collected the hints for the answer and summed it up.<p>I thank the huge amount of online resource that is available for learning and practice, especially geeeksforgeeks.org.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
