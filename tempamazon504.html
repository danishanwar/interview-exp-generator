Question was framed over working of Maven/Gradle. Given the dependencies of the packages to be installed.<br/>For example,<br/>A -&gt; B, C, D (Which means A depends upon B, C &amp; D. Hence, B,C &amp; D should be installed before installing A)<br/>B -&gt; F<br/>D -&gt; E<br/>Print the order in which packages should be installed.<br/>Later this question is modified and asked:<br/>Given an order of packages, tell whether with the given dependencies, is it possible to install packages in the given order or not.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2: (Face to Face) 1:20 Hours</strong><br/>Each of the f2f interviews were taken by the two interviewers. One was asking questions and other was observing the behavior of the candidate \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<ol>This round almost covered everything from Current Project to Data Structures and Problem solving to Behavioral questions to High level designing.<br/>Asked the architecture of the product that I am currently working on. Asked me to draw the block diagram and the interactions among the different components for 20mins.<br/>Later moved to Data Structures and Problem solving questions.</ol></p><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-sub-array/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array find the maximum contiguous sum. Array can have +ve and -ve elements.</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sum of two linked lists and store the result in the third one.</a><p>Behavioral Questions:<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><li>How did you help your colleague?<li>Tell an instance when you proposed some approach but your team lead did not like and how did you convince him.<p>Design question: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-movie-ticket-booking-system-like-bookmyshow/">Design BookMyShow</a> website. Asked me, how will I design UI pages?<br/>What things I did not like about BookMyShow? And then designing of DB, tables, constraints, etc.<br/>I nailed this round completely.<p><strong>Round 3: (Face to Face) 1:30 Hours</strong><br/>Asked about my current project.<br/>This round of mine did not go well. It was a purely about Data Structures.<ol><li>Given a binary tree, find the maximum BST subtree with the root of the max BST.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><br/>I gave initial approach where I wanted to traverse the tree in Inorder and store it in an array.<br/>After that find the subarray where elements present in increasing order. Interviewer showed some issues with that approach.<br/>Later modified the approach to bottom-up approach. Approach was fine but I could not write clear and running code.<li>Interviewer was confused whether to send me to the next round or not. He asked me one more question:<br/>Given an sorted array of alphabets find the count of each element. Told him the approach with Binary search and he was satisfied.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/frequency-of-array-elements/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4: (Face to Face) 1:30 Hours</strong><br/>Asked about my current project.<br/>This round was totally on designing.<ol><li>Given a piece of paper with some Java code.
