A few days later, she scheduled a telephone call where she asked some basic questions on complexity, worst case and best case for certain sorting algorithms, some short tricky math problems. You need to answer 8/10 correct to get shortlisted.<p>After this, I got around 20 days for 1st round of telephonic interview.<p><strong>Telephonic interview:\xc2\xa0</strong>It was a 45 min hangout call with a Google doc shared. She directly jumped onto the question.<br/>Q1.\xc2\xa0 Given two strings, A and B, of equal length, find whether it is possible to cut both strings at a common point such that the first part of A and the second part of B form a palindrome.<p>Extension1. How would you change your solution if the strings could be cut at any point (not just a common point)?<br/>Extension2. Multiple cuts in the strings (substrings to form a palindrome)? Form a palindrome using a substring from both strings. What is its time complexity?<br/>Q2. Come up with some edge test-cases\xc2\xa0for calculator\xc2\xa0function performing these operations :\xc2\xa0(+, -, \xc2\xa0*, /)\xc2\xa0<br/>I was called for onsite interviews 25 days after this round.<p><strong>Round 1: </strong>Given an input stream of boolean values, design a data structure that can support following modules in optimal time-<br/>i) setTrue(index)<br/>ii) setFalse(index)<br/>iii) setAllTrue()<br/>iv) setAllFalse()<br/>v) getIndex(index)<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2:</strong>Given a list of player names and their scores \xe2\x80\x93 {Carl, 70; Alex, 55; Isla, 40}, design a data structure that can support following modules in optimal time-<br/>i) updateEntry(string name)<br/>ii) getEntryFromRank(int rank)<p><strong>Round 3:<br/>Q1.\xc2\xa0</strong>Given an array of n integers, find the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length k.<br/><strong>Q2. </strong>Given a matrix of people(denoted by small alphabets) and bikes(denoted by capital alphabets), find the nearest bike for a given person.<br/>How will you change your solution if you have to find bikes for a set of people?
