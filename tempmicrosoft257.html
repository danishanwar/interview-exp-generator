Three coding questions were asked.<ol><li>Given a Linked List of integers, write a function to modify the linked list in-place such that all odd numbers appear before all the even numbers in the modified linked list. The relative order of even and odd numbers should remain the same. \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segregate-even-and-odd-elements-in-a-linked-list/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segregate-even-and-odd-elements-in-a-linked-list/</a><li>Given a floating point number, calculate its square root without using in-built sqrt() function.<li>Given a pattern string and a test string, implement RegEx substring matching. If the pattern is preceded by a ^, it will match with the starting position. Similarly, if it is preceded by a $, it will match the ending position. If no such markers are present, it will check whether pattern is a substring of test.<pre>Ex : ^coal\r\ncoaltar\r\nResult : True\r\ntar$\r\ncoaltar\r\nResult : True\r\nabcd\r\nefgh\r\nResult : False\r\n</pre></li></li></li></ol><p>25 students were selected for the next round.<br/><strong>Round 2(paper coding round):</strong><ol><li>Print boundary traversal of Binary tree in clockwise direction.(Note: check for leaf nodes in left and right traversal for a given tree). \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree/</a><li>Rotate a square image 90 degree clockwise.

Asked me all the approaches that I was able to implement . Then asked me to do in O(logn), where n is total no. of nodes .<li>Asked me to write code to find a no. occurring greater than n/2 times in an array . Then asked me to prove the written algorithm , basically , he was asking how I was able to write that code and why is it working .<br/>7 students were selected for further rounds.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4- Personal Interview\xc2\xa02</strong><ol><li>Asked me to implement seat booking process in BOOKMYSHOW.com . How to handle the cases where two persons are trying to access the same seat at almost same time . He told me to write class based solution asking about different functions that should be used to solve all the cases for booking procedure .<li>What is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/private-constructors-and-singleton-classes-in-java/">singleton class</a>?<li>\xc2\xa0How to<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-set-of-line-segments-find-if-any-two-segments-intersect/"> find the point of intersection of two line segments </a>. Two end points of line segments were given.<li>How to find no. of 2\xe2\x80\x99s between nos. 1 to n . He gave me few hints and finally , he was satisfied with my approach<li>Implement fibonacci series considering every possible solution .</li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>And few more questions were asked , but I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember them.\xc2\xa0<strong>6</strong> students were selected for further rounds.<p><strong>Round 5- Personal Interview\xc2\xa03</strong><ol><li>\xc2\xa0Write function for <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion/">inorder traversal of Binary tree without recursion.</a> That was easy !!<li>Asked me a puzzle question. An n*n board is given and one of the given cells is black .Also , L shaped pieces are given (equivalent to 3 cells of given matrix) , considering all possible rotations. I had to fill the entire grid using those pieces . Pieces can\xe2\x80\x99t be placed on the black cell and no two pieces should overlap , not even partially . I gave an answer where I tried to increase the size of unaccesiblecells( black cells and already placed pieces on board) to the size of the given board , but he asked me few cases where my answer failed. Then I said him we can do the exhaustive search of combinations using backtracking but it will take too much time . Then he gave me clue that instead of growing the size of unaccesible cells, try to decrease it. Finally , I concluded that it divide-n-conquer based solution considering base case as 2*2 board with 1 black cell.</li></li></ol><p><strong>4</strong> students were selected for further rounds.<p><strong>Round 6- Personal Interview 4</strong><p>He\xc2\xa0told me to implement <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-lru-cache/">LRU Cache</a> . I gave him all the solutions that can be possible . He was very helpful . He found flaws and told me to optimize it. I gave him 3 solutions and the final one is the one which you can find anywhere on the internet. But before that , he asked me to swap two nodes of a DLL using hashmap . I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what Lru Cache is initially .haha<p><strong>Round 7- Personal Interview\xc2\xa05</strong><ol><li>\xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your passion ? What you want to do in your life ? Hr-type question .<li>He designed a new language with the words of English and stored them in an array of strings . Then he gave me two strings and told me to design strcmpfunction . I told him the best method in one go , but he tried to confuse me and he was successful . He gave me 5 mins to come up with another solution and tried new one .Lastly , I implemented the first approach I had in mind and he was satisfied with it.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialize-deserialize-n-ary-tree/">How to serialize and deserialize an n-ary tree</a> . I told him the function for serializing and deserializing a binary tree but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with solution for the given problem.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>3</strong> students were finally selected for MS-IDC. I was one of them. :p<br/>P.S : I was not comfortable with OS and DBMS , so I told them clearly but they tried to ask indirectly all the basic questions of OS and DBMS , and told me to implement them using C/C++.<p><strong>Questions asked to my friends :</strong><ul><li>Developing an algorithm for crossing bridges problem , where no. of elements is n.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-and-intersection-of-two-linked-lists/">Intersection of two linked lists.</a><li>Find <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-function-to-detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/">if loop is present in linked list </a>and also ,find the start node of the loop in it .<li>Class design for banking system.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-reverse-the-nodes-of-a-linked-list/">Reverse linked list using both recursion and iteration</a> etc etc</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
