You have to fit some text into the screen. Give the maximum size of letters that one can have such that the text fits into the screen.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>My Approach :</strong> I gave a brute force approach where in we run a loop from smallest font possible to largest font possible and fit as many letters as possible in one line of the phone screen and give the best result.<p>When asked to further improve my approach, I suggested a binary search based solution where I took a mid value for font and see if the text fits or not. If it does then I iterate for a higher half and if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t then I iterate for the lower half.<p>At last I was asked the time complexity of each solution.<p>Since my first round of phone interview \xc2\xa0went well, I was directly selected for on-site interviews.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
