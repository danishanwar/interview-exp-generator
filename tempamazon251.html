C basics should be strong.<p>Coding: 2 coding questions<br/>They have a pool of about 20 questions from which they give 2 random questions.<br/>1) <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dice-throw-dp-30/">Dice Throw | DP-30</a><br/>2) Given a starting and ending time of events and only 1 event can take place at a time, print the maximum number of events that can take place. (Hint: Sort on the basis of start time and take a greedy approach)<p><strong>Round 2(Face to Face Interview)</strong><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-top-view-binary-tree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print Nodes in Top View of Binary Tree</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>I started with a level order traversal approach, then he moved on and asked to do the same with a preorder traversal. I had used a map to store the nodes and then print them after the complete traversal but then he asked me to improve the print operation and for that I used an unordered_map and a min index for the complete traversal. Then he asked me for the changes to make it a bottom view.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>He went onto ask a few concepts of Operating Systems like Process, Threads, deadlocks and Scheduling.<p><strong>Round 3(Face to Face Interview)</strong><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-largest-element-bst-using-constant-extra-space/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">K\xe2\x80\x99th Largest element in BST using constant extra space</a><br/>He questioned about the approach and tried to dig if I had seen such a question earlier.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-subset-of-rectangles-such-that-no-rectangle-fit-in-any-other-rectangle/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Largest subset of rectangles such that no rectangle fit in any other rectangle</a><br/>It was a modified version of the question(Just give the biggest element in the subset).</li></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>He then asked me about the strongest point on my resume and discussed deeply on the topic for about 20 mins.<p><strong>Round 4(Face to Face Interview)</strong><br/>Given an array of R and C, where R represents a rabbit at that location and C represents a carrot at that location and an integer D, a rabbit can eat a maximum of 1 carrot within the range D. Output the maximum number of carrots that could be eaten.<br/>I gave a solution of O(n+d) but he made me improve it to O(n).<p><strong>Round 5(Face to Face Interview)</strong><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-of-palindromic-paths-in-a-matrix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Number of palindromic paths in a matrix</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>The interviewer helped out a bit though. Asked a few minor things from the resume. He then relaxed the environment and asked about my hobbies.<p>In all the interviews they started by asking the approach and at the end we had to finally code up the problem.<br/><strong>Result</strong><br/>Converted.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
