There were 2 coding questions as well.<p>Question 1: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/possible-words-from-phone-digits/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You are given a phone keypad like following diagram, where each character corresponds to a digit mentioned in the same box.</a><br/><img alt="Mobile-keypad" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-176523" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Mobile-keypad-267x300.png" srcset="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-keypad-267x300.png 267w, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-keypad.png 326w" width="267"/><p>You are given n strings and you have to find their decimal representation. You have to print the string and corresponding decimal representation in descending order.<br/>Like if you are given \xe2\x80\x9camazon\xe2\x80\x9d then its corresponding decimal notation will be 262966.<br/>If more than one strings have same decimal notation then you have to print them in the order in which input is given.<br/>(Given that given string consists of lower case alphabets only.)<pre>Test Case 1:\r\n5\r\nAmazon\r\nMicrosoft\r\nFacebook\r\nAa\r\nBb\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n642767638  microsoft\r\n32232665  facebook\r\n262966  amazon\r\n22 aa\r\n22 bb</pre><p>Question 2: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/permutations-of-a-given-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a string.

He also asked me to write code for one of my mini project (Backtracking).<br/>Then he asked two back to back coding questions \xe2\x80\x93<p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You are given a bst. You have to print the kth smallest element.</a><p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-median/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You are given two sorted arrays and you have to print the median obtained after merging them in log(n) time complexity.</a><p>Then he asked the language in which I am comfortable for coding. I said C . Then he asked me to allocate the dynamic memory of 2-d array in C( I used malloc function for this). Then he asked me the difference b/w malloc and new (c++) function.<p><strong>Round 2 (P.I. 2):-</strong><br/>Firstly he asked me to tell about my academic background. Then he directly put a coding question in front of me.<br/>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/min-distance-between-two-given-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> You are given a binary tree and two nodes. You have to print the horizontal distance between them.</a><p>Let us say :<br/>Given nodes are B and C : Answer would be 2.<br/>Given nodes are A and E : Answer would be 0.<br/>Given nodes are D and G : Answer would be 4.<p>We had an long discussion of 45 mins (approx.) on this problem.<p>One of my friend was asked the following questions:<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-linked-list-is-pallindrome/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a linked list. You have to determine whether or not it is a palindrome in order O(n) time without using auxiliary space.</a><br/>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/kadanes-algorithm/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You are given an array of integers . You have to find the maximum sum sequence.</a>(It needs not be contiguous).<p>After all these rounds I and my friend both were selected \xf0\x9f\x99\x82 :). A total of 16 candidates were selected.<br/>I really thank to GEEKSFORGEEKS for all the support and help in my preparation.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
