Given an array of numbers ranging from 1-6 you have to merge add K elements[ in the range 1-6] in the array such that the mean of the array after adding elements become F, we need to return an array of K elements if it was not possible we need to return an empty array.\xc2\xa0<pre>example\n1.a)input-&gt;arr=[1,2,3,4] k=2 f=3.0\noutput-&gt;[1,2,3,4,5,3] \n//since the mean of the new array is 3\n1.b)input-&gt; arr=[1,1,1] k=1 f=6\noutput=[]</pre><p>2. Given a string of a,b, and/or? You can replace it? with a or b. task is to replace all? such that no three consecutive a or b occurs in the string. it is given that such string will always exist we needed to return the modified string.\xc2\xa0<pre>example\n2.a) input-&gt;b?aa?\noutput-&gt;bbaab</pre><p>The test was conducted on their platform cordiality, unlike other OA you can submit your code only once ie once submitted you can not edit your code<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Those who did solve both questions were shortlisted for Interviews<p><strong><u>INTERVIEW ROUNDS: </u></strong>The Interview rounds were held on MS teams and for coding was done on their codility platform similar to codepair hackerrank.<p><strong>ROUND 1: </strong>We exchanged greetings then the interviewer asked me the challenges that we were facing in online mode.<p>Then she gave me a question:<ul><li>Given a string, we need to find whether the string satisfies the following condition:<li>for each character at ith positon(where 0&lt;=i&lt;n) there should not be same character in the window i/2 to the left and i/2 to right<li>expected time complexity-O(n), space complexity-O(1)<li>After trying out brute force, then binary search methods<li>I asked for the hint, with help of hint I was able to do it code it using hashmap<li>This Round lasted for around 40 mins</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>I was shortly called for round 2 after this round.<p><strong>ROUND 2: </strong>We exchanged greetings and the interviewer asked for my introduction.<p>He then gave a question.<ol><li>Given an array of n numbers ranging from 1-255, I needed to design a class to compress it to reduce the size of array and decompress to get back original array. Unlike the previous round expected time and space complexity was not specified. (Soln: 1 declared an array of unsigned int (32 bits)of size n/4 and each number can be can store 4 numbers since in the original array max number of bits are 8(255=11111111 in binary)</li></ol><p>The interviewer seemed satisfied with my approach and asked me to code it out.<p>After that we had a discussion on some follow-up questions given below<ol><li>What will change if number would range from 0-255 instead of 1-255 .<li>Where this algorithm can be applied.</li></li></ol><p>This Round lasted for around 1 hour 20 mins.<p>I was shortly called for round 3.<p><strong>ROUND 3: </strong>It was HR cum coding round. It was taken by a very senior person,<p>Coding Questions<ol><li>Kadane\xe2\x80\x99s Algorithm.<li>Given an array, print unique elements in decreasing order of their frequency.</li></li></ol><p>HR Questions:<ol><li>Why did you take CSE?<li>Why did you choose this college?<li>Your strengths and weaknesses.<li>Name any recent techstack which had impressed me a lot.<li>Future Goals<li>Why Microsoft?<li>Elaborate one team project experience. What were the challenges you faced and how did you overcome it?<li>Name any product/techstack which you think had most important impact in the pandemic.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>This Round lasted for around 50 mins.<p>Verdict: Selected.<p><strong>NOTE/TIPS:</strong><ol><li>All interviewers were very experienced and friendly. They gave helpful hints whenever I was going in wrong direction. So whenever you are stuck make sure to ask for hints.<li>Microsoft focuses more on basics but in all three interviews and OA the emphasis was made that code should be correct with minimum number of corrections.<li>In all three interviews, I was expected to think all edge cases where my code may fail.<li>At the end of every round make sure you ask something about profile from interview when they ask \xe2\x80\x9cdo you have any questions for me?\xe2\x80\x9d.<li>While writing code be sure to be interactive and discussing each and every line that you are writing with the interviewer.<li>At last but not least, be confident and believe in yourself.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
