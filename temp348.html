Where 1 is a valid path piece. Given a src and dst also. Need to find out minimum number of steps to reach destination from Source.</a><p>Question 2. Amazon transport centre ships there items in trucks of some size. And each item take some space. And for safety purpose we have to keep a some given space empty in truck.<p>We are given a array of size of items[10,20,30,40], size of truck(100) and safety space(40). We have to find a pair of items which can be shipped safely and utilising maximum space in truck.<p>So in given example we will ship pair(20 &amp; 40) with keeping 40 space.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 1: Telephonic:</strong><p>Question 1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/final-destination/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a matrix of 1 &amp; 0.

Given a function f(x) =y, where 0&lt;x&lt;10000 &amp; if x1&lt;x2 then y1 &lt; y2 for every x. Now we have to write f(y) = x function. Which will take input as some y and will return x.<p><strong>Round 2: Design LLD + HLD:</strong><p>Question 1. Asked about my project and we discussed deeply about it\xe2\x80\x99s challanges for its features.<p>Question 2. Social Media Platform design. He asked me to give only 4 features.
