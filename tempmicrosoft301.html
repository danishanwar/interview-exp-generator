Branches eligible was CS and IT. There were a total of 4 rounds.<p><strong>Round 1: MCQ round</strong><br/>In this round there were a total of 15 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s and the time alloted was 30 mins.The questions were mainly from C/C++/Java output finding, pointers and references and basic puzzles.<br/>I was able to solve 12 + mcq\xe2\x80\x99s. I managed to qualify this round.<p><strong>Round 2: ONLINE CODING ROUND</strong><br/>In this round 2 coding questions were given to us which need to be solved in 1hr time.<p>1st question:<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/">minimum time required so that all oranges become rotten</a><p>2nd question:<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>You are provided with a binary tree and given two integers n and k.You have to determine sum of data of all the nodes which are at a distance of k from the node which has data n.<br/>I managed to solve question no. 2 completely .Both using BFS.Here is my way of how I did it:-<p>1. Use BFS directly to traverse the array once and can obtain the solution in O(n^2) only.<p>2. Form a graph out of the tree with the found node as the source point and then do BFS Sum to find the required answer.<p><strong>Round 3: Face To Face Interview Round(150 mins)</strong><br/>1. A brief discussion on my projects.(About 2048 game in JAVA and some other projects I did.)<p>2. To tell something about me and elaborate my hobbies .<p>3. List of stations and distances between them are given and find all pairs shortest distance.(Floyd warshall algorithm in O(V^3).)<p>4. Given 1 billion numbers.Remove duplicates in O(n) and the range of numbers are till 10^5.(I used A[abs(A[i])] method to change sign and remove.It impressed the interviewer a lot.)<br/>5. Implement Dictionary(I asked about the basic layout and was told that lot of words have been already entered each having its definition,synonyms and antonyms).(I started from vector &lt; vector&lt; string&gt; &gt; , then HashMap, then Set &lt;string,pair &gt; and then RB Tree approach too.)<p>6.I was asked to write the pseudo code for each of the above data structures and their complexities of search,insertion and updation.<br/>-I gave all the answers in this round .<p><strong>Round 4: Technical Round(90 mins)</strong><br/>1.I was asked to throw some light on some trending technologies.(I explained about Cloud,Big Data etc.) It took 30 mins and he looked impressed.<p>2. Next I was asked that if I were placed at IDC or IT then which one I will prefer and why.It was interactive session and finally I opted for MSIT mentioning him the reasons and he gave his final feedback on me.<br/>-I gave all the answers in this round .<p>Hope my experience helps everyone.<br/>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
