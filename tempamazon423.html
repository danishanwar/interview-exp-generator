All interviews were back to back. It started from 11 AM to 5:30 PM with just half an hour lunch break. Before I could even step out after completing one round, other interviewers would already be waiting outside. Interviewers were very helping, but only if your are thinking in the right direction. HR also was very supportive. He was coming and motivating me after every round. Some advices here<div><ul><li>If your couldn\xe2\x80\x99t solve a problem, don\xe2\x80\x99t carry forward negative thoughts into next round. It will affect the next round as well.<li>If your have prepared well, importance of keeping calm and cool should not be ignored. Trust me, you won\xe2\x80\x99t survive the stress of whole day otherwise.<li>All the codes you would be asked to write down on paper and designs on the white boards, so practise accordingly.<li>Prepare for the design interviews well, they play a big role for SDE 2.</li></li></li></li></ul><div></div></div><div class="yj6qo ajU"><div class="ajR" id=":10s" role="button"></div></div><p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
