It started with a online screening round and followed by one telephonic and then 3 face to face interview and again a telephonic interview.<p><strong>Online screening :</strong><br/>There were 20 multiple choice questions from Computer science fundamentals (OS, DS, DBMS, Networks etc.) and basic input/output questions, some aptitude questions and 2 coding questions:-<br/>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-difference-pair/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given an array find the minimum difference between any pair.</a><br/>2. Write a function that returns true if a given undirected graph is tree and false otherwise. <a href="http://geeksquiz.com/check-given-graph-tree">http://geeksquiz.com/check-given-graph-tree</a><p><strong>Telephonic Interview :</strong><br/>Interview started with brief introduction about me and my projects, then started with coding questions.<br/>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-mirror-in-n-ary-tree/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given two trees return yes if the order of leaves in tree are mirror image of each other.</a><br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of n numbers. another array with same elements but numbers are shuffled and one element is removed. Find the missing element.(without using any extra space and in O(n) ).</a><br/>Then if both the array are sorted then how to find the missing element. (without extra space and in O(log n)).<br/>Then they called me for onsite interview and 3 face to face interview were conducted there.<p><strong>Face-to-Face Interview 1 :</strong><br/>He started with a brief introduction and asked me my about my projects in detail.<br/>then moved to coding questions:-<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/linked-list-in-zig-zag-fashion/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arrange Linked List elements in zig-zag pattern such that a &lt; b &gt; c &lt; d &gt; e</a> \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6<p>(without using extra space and Time complexity O(n)).<br/>Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to handle edge cases.<br/>(This is array implementation of same question).<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-left-leaf-nodes/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a binary tree. return sum of all Left Leaf nodes.</a><br/>Left leaves meaning leaf node which is left child of his parent.<p><strong><br/>Face-to-face Interview 2 :</strong><br/>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-two-nodes-are-cousins/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given two nodes of a binary tree,check they are cousins or not.</a> (Both Iterative and recursive solution).<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-two-nodes-cousins-binary-tree">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-two-nodes-cousins-binary-tree</a><br/>2. Given an array with N elements (numbers from 0 to N-1). Find all duplicate elements.<br/>I gave a solution with hashing, he asked me to do without extra space.<br/>Then I gave solution with sorting the array, he asked me to do with only single traversal and without extra space.<p><strong><br/>Face-to-face Interview 3 :</strong><br/>Started with brief introduction and some questions from my projects and CS fundamentals (OS,Networks).<br/>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/word-break/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.</a><p><strong><br/>Telephonic Interview :</strong><br/>The interviewer asked me to introduce myself, and after that he asked some behavioural question like-<br/>Have you got offer from any other company ?<br/>Why are you intersted in joining AMAZON ?<br/>1.
