You can remove elements either from start or from end of the array if above condition does not meet. No of removals should be minimum. </a>(algo + code)<br/>For example a, b, c, d, e f are the elements of array, c is the min num and e is max no<br/>condition 2*c &gt; e is true then we are done but if false then remove either from start i.e. a,b,c or from end i.e. e, f such that new min or max would satisfy the condition and removals should be minimum.<br/>Q3.

Extend above for multiplication (multiplication of left side elements equal to multiplication of right side elements)<br/>(special case of Zero and some discussion on arithmetic exception and range bound errors)<p><strong>F2F 2 (60 \xe2\x80\x93 65 minutes)</strong><br/>Some general introductory questions; why are looking for a change and work experience.<br/>Q1. For a given number K, print all pairs of valid parenthesis combination and return the total count of such combinations.<br/>Q2. There are n balls kept on a table and connected in random fashion but there is no cycle (no back edge). Write the code to select a ball such that after lifting the whole structure from that ball height will be minimum. (algo+code+ mathematical proof of correctness)<br/>Q3. Difference b/w http and https.<br/>Q4. Suppose you are handling Amazon website and you have 10 MB size home page.
