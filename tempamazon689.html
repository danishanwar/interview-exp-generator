This can be achieved iteratively increasing \xe2\x80\x98x\xe2\x80\x99 and checking for a downward slope condition. The step could be constant, but an exponential increase would let to the point faster. I was asked to prove this by giving the recurrence relation and hence showing the complexity. I was further asked to code the entire algorithm using any language of my choice where I used c.<p><strong><br/>Interview 2</strong><br/>The interviewer asked me about networks in relation to sockets and ports when he saw an academic project that was mentioned in my resume.<br/>The interview questions were as follows:<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-path-sum/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a binary tree where value at each node is a single digit, find the sum of numbers generated by each root to leaf path. He also asked to code the primary function for the same. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the exact question on geeksforgeeks, but this one is close enough</a><p>2)<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/possible-words-from-phone-digits/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given a numpad such that every number is associated with a set of letters, give all combinations of strings that could be formed given a string of numbers. He also asked to code the primary function for the same.</a><p><strong><br/>Interview 3</strong><br/>1) Given an array of integers, find a subset of numbers from this array such that, after negating the elements of this set, the total sum of all elements would be equal to zero.<br/>I could not solve the problem and he moved on to the next one after giving me a hint to use Dynamic Programming<p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-median/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given two sorted arrays find the median of the merged array without using extra space. I gave an O(N) Solution and he asked me to give an O(log(N)) solution,which I gave after I put in some thought</a><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>3) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/zigzag-tree-traversal/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print a binary tree in a zigzag order level wise</a>. I gave an implementation using a doubly ended queue, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied as this would lead to extra space complexity for storing the levels in the d-queue. He was pleased when I decided to use 2 queues for the same. He further asked me to code it up<p><strong>Interview 4</strong><br/>1) The interviewer asked me about the types of database I knew and elaborated a bit on non-relational databases like mongodb and JSON.<p>2) Next, he asked me the need for indexing in databases and it\xe2\x80\x99s implementation.<p>3) In an auctioning system, the bidder with the highest bid wins but charged at kth highest price. Develop a system for it. Solved it using a hashmap. Was asked to write a code for the same.<p>4) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/element-appearing-once/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array such that all elements except one are duplicate, find this element. He tweaked the problem to add the condition that in stead of one there are 2 such elements.</a> I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive to a solution even after he gave me some hints. In the end he gave me the answer but immediately said that it may not work. I realized why it did work and explained the reason for the same.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
