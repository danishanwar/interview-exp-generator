He asked me about my summer internship and the selection procedure. Then he asked me about my project including workflow, efficiency consideration and various typical questions. I answered all of them.</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">2)He gave me first question. In a parliament, there are 500 constituencies, each constituency stand for a vote and there are [0, m] votes that can be casted. Tell which constituency will win. In a parliament the constituency which get more that 50% of votes will be a winner. I generated various test cases and confirmed the answer from him. I conveyed my approach handling all corner cases. He was satisfied with my approach.</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">3)Given an array of integers, find the largest number which can be formed. I again generated various test cases to confirm the question. Later, I discussed my approach and was asked to code. He checked by taking various test cases.</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">4)Later, he asked me to implement tic tac toe and some discussion on best possible data structure to be implemented.</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The interviewer was really helpful and the r<strong>ound ended well.</strong></span><p class="c5"><strong><span class="c0">\xc2\xa0</span><span class="c3">Round-4(Technical Interview)</span></strong><p class="c5"><span class="c0">1)Given N-ary tree, find the length of the longest path of the consecutive integers. I discussed the approach to which I was asked to code.</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">2)Given pairs [m, n] such that in a race, position of m&gt;n i.e. m finishes race before n. Find the order in which all the players finish the race. Being a sportsperson, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t difficult to crack this one!</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">The interviewer seems to be satisfied. I was waiting for the next round.</span><p class="c5" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Tips:- Always discuss the first approach you have in your mind and then think for the optimised solution.</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Around 9 were selected after this round.</span><p class="c5"><strong><span class="c3">Round-5(HR + Technical)</span></strong><p class="c5"><span class="c0">1) Given a string, replace the substring with a value present in the map. I discussed the approach and one of the test cases failed to which I was asked to rethink my solution. I discussed another approach to which he said ok.</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">2) Question from project. I did a project using ruby on rails. I was asked about some security checks which can be implemented in a website as a developer and various gems implementation. The discussion went till hacking and I tried answering them. The interviewer asked me some basic questions on my other projects.</span><p class="c5"><span class="c0">At the end, I was among one of the four selects!</span><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
