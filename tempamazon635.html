There were two coding questions.<p>1) Given an integer n in the input, find its next sparse binary numberA sparse binary number is a number whose binary representation does not contain any consecutive 1s.<p>For eg.<br/>72 is a sparse binary number, because its binary representation (01001000) does not contain any consecutive 1s.<br/>17 is a sparse binary number, because its binary representation (00010001) does not contain any consecutive 1s.<p>Similarly,<br/>12 is a non sparse binary number, because its binary representation (00001100) contains consecutive 1s.<br/>43 is a non sparse binary number, because its binary representation (00101011) contains consecutive 1s.<p>Now, given an integer n in the input, find its next sparse binary number. n itself can be sparse or non sparse.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>where n &gt;= 0 and n &lt; 2^31\nInput 12\nOutput\n16\nExplanation\n12 is 00001100 and next sparse no. to it is 16 (00010000).\n2) You are given heights of n candles.\nFirst day you lit one candle s\nScond day you need to lit two candles\nThird day you need to lit three candles\n..........\n........\ntill possible.\nAfter lighting candles the height of candles deduced by 1 each day.You can also extinguish any candle you want but only at the end of day.\nSo you need to tell the maximum number number of days , you can carry on lighting the candles.\nExample : there are three candles of heights {2 , 2 ,2 }\nAnswer : 3\n1.You light first candle on day one. heights -&gt; {1,2,2}<br/>2.You light second and third and extinguish first one . heights -&gt;{1, 1,1}<br/>3.You light all the candles. heights -{0,0,0}<p>Hope it helps aspirants.<p>Online mcq, there were around 20 and 13-14 were from <a href="http://geeksquiz.com/">geeksquiz.com</a><p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
