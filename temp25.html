Each set had two coding questions and mcqs based mostly on c/c++.\xc2\xa0 My coding questions were 1) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-inversions/ and 2) finding the number of derangements.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 2(F-2-F): </strong>Started straight away with ds algo stuff. First question:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-maximum-sum-combinations-two-arrays/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-maximum-sum-combinations-two-arrays/</a>. Second question was based on topological sort of a directed graph. I had to write code for both questions. Attention was given to code quality and edge cases.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 3(F-2-F):</strong> Again, the focus was on ds algo.\xc2\xa0<ul><li>At first, was given a stream of transactions and the task was to find the kth most expensive transaction. A few approaches were discussed, and then I had to code up the best approach I could come up with.\xc2\xa0<li>The second question was\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/</a>. Had to code it up. The third question was a modification on finding the intersection between two linked lists. There were other small questions in between, specially pertaining to Priority Queue and its implementation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 4(F-2-F):</strong> Given a hierarchical structure, where a node calls another node for a service, and that node may call other node(s) for a service, find the longest time taken for two \xe2\x80\x98leaves\xe2\x80\x99 of this hierarchical structure to communicate with each other. This was just a modified version of finding the longest leaf to leaf path in a tree-like structure.\xc2\xa0<ul><li>The second question:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nuts-bolts-problem-lock-key-problem/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nuts-bolts-problem-lock-key-problem/</a>.\xc2\xa0<li>3rd question was finding the largest island in a grid.\xc2\xa0<li>There were small other questions as well, like the previous round.\xc2\xa0<li>Had to code everything.\xc2\xa0</li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 5(Bar Raiser):\xc2\xa0</strong><ul><li>Discussion about CV.<li>Why I am sitting for coding profile, being from a non CS/IT background.\xc2\xa0<li>Then, was asked to implement LRU Cache. Special notice was taken on the code.\xc2\xa0<li>Then, was asked the trapping rain water problem, but do it with O(1) space and single pass. Had to code up the solution.\xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0</p></li></li></li></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
