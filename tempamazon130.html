Each round was about 1 hour. \xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 2(Technical Interview):</strong><ol><li>The interviewer gave me a piece of code with switch statements and asked me to discuss what the code was intended for and fix the bugs.<li>Tell me about your project.<li>Write a logic to see if you can accommodate all the even numbers in the array at even indices. Print Yes/No accordingly.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3(Technical + Behavioral):</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Tell me about a time when you were given feedback, and you did something to improve on it.<li>Left View of a binary tree.<li>Tell me about a time when you convinced someone to make something that only you\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to do.<li>Paint fill problem, I gave DFS approach, but the interviewer was looking for an optimized approach. He gave me several hints to use BFS but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch them :/ But finally when I said we can use a queue the time was up:)</li></li></li></li></ol><p><span style="background-color:#fff;color:rgba(0,0,0,.87)"><strong>Rou</strong></span><strong>nd 4(Technical):</strong><ol><li>The interviewer asked me about my projects. Please explain everything in detail, as much as you can during that time.<li>Find the second largest element in an array(sorting not allowed).<li>Check if one string is a rotation of another.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Tips:</strong><ol><li>Be calm and do not rush during the interview, take time and ask more questions for clarity, the interviewers are very happy to help.<li>Please explain your approach clearly (Do it with confidence) and then move on to code.<li>And at the end of the interview, when the interviewer finally asks do you have any questions for me? \xc2\xa0I would say go ahead and ask a few appropriate questions, this creates a conversation and interviewers will feel good that you\xe2\x80\x99re curious about things.</li></li></li></ol><p>Overall, it was a great experience and I would like to thank GeeksforGeeks for providing a platform to share my experience.
