Each team has a car and a driver. Car\xe2\x80\x99s specification are as follows:<br/>\xe2\x80\x93 Top speed: (150 + 10 * i) km per hour<br/>\xe2\x80\x93 Acceleration: (2 * i) meter per second square.<br/>\xe2\x80\x93 Handling factor (hf) = 0.8<br/>\xe2\x80\x93 Nitro : Increases the speed to double or top speed, whichever is less. Can be used only once.<p>Here i is the team number.<br/>The cars line up for the race. The start line for (i + 1)th car is 200 * i meters behind the ith car.<p>All of them start at the same time and try to attain their top speed. A re-assessment of the positions is done every 2 seconds(So even if the car has crossed the finish line in between, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get to know after 2 seconds). During this assessment, each driver checks if there is any car within 10 meters of his car, his speed reduces to: hf * (speed at that moment). Also, if the driver notices that he is the last one on the race, he uses \xe2\x80\x98nitro\xe2\x80\x99.<p>Taking the number of teams and length of track as the input, Calculate the final speeds and the corresponding completion times.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
