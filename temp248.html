Here is my interview experience at Amazon for an internship.<p>Duration \xe2\x80\x93 6 months<p>Rounds \xe2\x80\x93 1 online test + 2 Personal Interviews (F2F)<p><strong>Round 1:</strong><p>The first round was comparatively easy. Here I had to give an online test which consists of 20 MCQs in which there were general aptitude questions, OOP, output, etc. In addition to this, there were 2 coding questions:<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-of-ways-to-get-a-given-sum-with-n-number-of-m-faced-dices/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-of-ways-to-get-a-given-sum-with-n-number-of-m-faced-dices/</a><li>This was a question on String that I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>For this and the next round, I was called to Bangalore. This round was of 1hr approx. I was asked 2 coding questions:<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays-set-2-different-sized-arrays/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays-set-2-different-sized-arrays/</a>, there was a slight difference though. If there are k arrays, the last array had n elements but the total size of this array was equal to the sum of sizes of all the other arrays and n. I was not allowed to use any extra space. To solve this question, I had to use a max heap of size k from the end of and the result was inserted at the end of the last array each time.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>This round was of 1hr 20 mins. In this round, there were 3 parts, first and last were coding while the second was the theory. The 3 parts in the sequence were:<ol><li>Each node in a tree generally has utmost 1 parent and 2 children, in the given tree each node can have utmost 2 parents and 2 children. Each node had a value associated with it. I had to find the maximum sum that I can get by traversing from the root to the leaf most efficient manner. The values of each node can be negative too. I had to solve this in O(n).\xc2\xa0 To solve this I had used Dynamic Programming.<li>Regarding the theory questions, the questions were:<ol><li>Difference between ipv4 and ipv6 except for the length.<li>What is memory virtualization?</li></li></ol><p>There were 2 more questions, to be honest, I was not able to answer any of the theory questions that the interviewer asked me. When I was not able to answer the questions, he asked me to tell him about my projects. I explained all the projects I had. He also told me to tell of what all I knew about the Operating System and I explained everything I knew for 15-20 minutes.<li>Given an array of nodes, each node represents a road which connects 2 cities. I need to find whether there exists a path between the given source and destination city. The roads are can be traversed in both the directions i.e from A to B and from B to A. First I created a hash map of type &lt;String, ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()&gt; ((city), (consisting of all the cities that I can reach from that city)) and then I applied BFS on it. Refer to the link to understand the BFS part \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-if-there-is-a-path-between-two-vertices-in-a-given-graph/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-if-there-is-a-path-between-two-vertices-in-a-given-graph/</a></li></p></li></li></ol><p>I was able to answer all the coding questions properly but not the theory questions but luckily I was selected \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p>Important Advice \xe2\x80\x93 Don\xe2\x80\x99t give up on the coding questions, keep trying till you find a solution. If you get stuck on something, the interviewer gives you a hint to help you out. Even if you are not able to answer the theory questions but can solve the coding questions well then you will get selected.<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>Selected</strong><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
