I am not quite sure the reason behind such a delay.</li></li></ul><p>Interview Call:<ul><li>I was informed about the dates 10 days prior to the interview and they sent me the meeting links (Amazon Chime and Livecode) 2-3 days before the interview.<li>They also sent a mail describing their company principles, their expectation from an SDE, and tips and helpful links to prepare for the interview.<li>They also confirmed my availability on the day of the interview over a call.</li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 2: </strong>Technical Round 1:<ul><li>The interviewer introduced himself by describing his role at Amazon before asking me \xe2\x80\x9ctell me something about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d.<li>Then he asked a coding question: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-dictionary-find-precedence-characters/">Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language, find </a>the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-dictionary-find-precedence-characters/">order of characters</a>. He first wanted to know my approach before asking me to write a pseudo code.<li>I did not know the GFG solution so I tried to solve it by myself. I came pretty close to the original solution, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fully accurate.<li>The interviewer pointed out some cases where my code will not work and while doing so asked some technical questions related to it: mostly graph, tree, linked-list related.</li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3: </strong>Technical Round 2:<ul><li>After one hour of the completion of the first round, the second round began. It started in a similar fashion with both of us introducing ourselves.<li>The first coding question I was given was: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree/">Find </a>the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree/">Maximum width of a binary tree</a>. I was to present a pseudo-code first and once he liked my approach he immediately asked me to write the function.<li>I wrote it and he suggested some improvements and then moved on to the next question: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/">Find Next Greater Element</a>.<li>I solved it very quickly as I practiced it few days before the interview. He asked me about the time and space complexities of my solution.<li>Once both of the coding questions were done, he asked me some behavioral questions as there were some times left.<li>He asked if I want to mention any key event as my career highlight. Based on my answer he again asked some questions like what particular issue I found and how I went on to solve it (I probably should have told all the details, but I wanted to keep it short ).<li>Finally, he asked me if I had any questions for him.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>Unfortunately, I did not make it to the further managerial rounds, but it was a nice experience nonetheless and it boosted my confidence as I was able to answer 2/3 coding questions and I believe that I can surely improve by practicing more. I hope my experience can help other aspiring candidates in their preparation.
