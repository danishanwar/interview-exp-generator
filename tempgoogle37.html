The internship program focuses on providing development opportunities to students from historically underrepresented groups in tech through technical training and professional development.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Experience of online coding challenge: </strong>Challenge was conducted on HackerEarth platform. The time duration was of 1 hour for solving 2 given coding questions.\xc2\xa0<ol><li>1st question was of a higher level than the 2nd one as it also comprises of more points. 1st question was based on graph theory including the use of various algorithms.\xc2\xa0<li>2nd question was based on set and it can be solved using C++ \xc2\xa0Stl. I could only solve one of the two problems i.e. the 2nd one completely.
