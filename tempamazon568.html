He wanted to see how I approach the given problem and further optimize it gradually.<p><strong><br/>3rd Round \xe2\x80\x93 F2F Interview</strong><br/>Interviewer started with my projects and slowly came to Operating system. He asked few questions related to it-<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>1) What is a page fault?<br/>2) How does it affect the CPU performance?<br/>3) How to minimize it? (I talked about LRU)<br/>He asked me to design LRU using appropriate Data Structures.<br/>I did it using doubly linked list and map. Then, he talked about complexity of my solution and wrapped up the interview by asking if I had any questions for him.<p><strong><br/>Few advises</strong> \xe2\x80\x93 First, be cool and don\xe2\x80\x99t be nervous because interviewer wants you to be interactive and confident. Think out loud and keep discussing with interviewer about any of your queries. Lastly, just memorising algorithms won\xe2\x80\x99t do any good. One has to learn the art of developing logic of a problem.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
