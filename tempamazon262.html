Level of difficulty was very easy.<br/><strong>Section B:</strong><br/>This section was having around 30 CS theoretical and some output based question, solely based on Data Structures and Algorithms.<p><strong>This round was held in my college [JSSATE] and around 15 students were selected from my college.</strong><br/><strong>The interview was held in G.L. Bajaj College and around 120 students were there</strong><br/><strong>Round 2: Technical Interview-1 [80-90 minutes]</strong><br/>They directly dive into asking DS Algo questions.<ol><li>Given a binary tree.

Starting from top left cell, reach bottom-right cell with optimum path such that maximum positive sum is received.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2: Technical Interview-2 [90-120 minutes]</strong><br/>After having intro they just dive into asking DS Algo questions.<ol><li>Given a BST, initially two nodes are swapped. Now correct the BST.<li>Given a array containing continuous numbers starting with 1 in sorted order. One number is missing in this. Find out that number.<li>Make your own data-structure through with insertion, deletion, searching and finding random number can be done in O(1) time complexity.
