Producers produce different kind of messages and Consumers register themselves for different kind of messages. Need to design and implement Producer, Consumer and a Delegator which is responsible for storing and delivering the messages to appropriate listeners.<br/>Changed the question to handle millions of messages.<br/>Changed the question to handle different priority messages.<br/>Threading model for Producer, Listener and Delegator.<p>In the end he asked me to code 2 methods of Delegator.<br/>1: which adds the message from Producer to its internal queue.<br/>2: Delegate, which delivers the message to appropriate listener.<br/>My Opinion: There is no right or wrong answer for design question, in fact the interviewer also told the same thing. Start with something simple, a minimalist design and improve/change as requirement changes.<p><strong>F2F Round 2:</strong><br/>1. A MxN matrix containing integers (positive, negative and zero\xe2\x80\x99s). For every position containing 0, mark the corresponding row and column as 0.<br/>Told him the queue approach. But he wanted with O(1) space complexity in O(n) time complexity.<br/>2. Variation of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-k-most-frequent-words-from-a-file/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-k-most-frequent-words-from-a-file/</a><p><strong>F2F Round 3:</strong><br/>1. Implement Power(x,y) without loop. Interviewer wanted all test cases covered like Power(x,0) and most optimized solution.<br/>2. Rotate MxN matrix by 90 degress. This is where my luck ran out, The interviewer gave me hint, but still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with solution.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
