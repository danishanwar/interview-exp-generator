Around 120 students sat for it. 15 MCQs were asked- Everyone had different sets. All sorts of questions were asked, I had each question on C, STL, sorting, Java, Computer Architecture and OS.<p><strong>Second round- Coding.</strong><br/>Around 60 students were shortlisted and coding round was conducted the same day. Everyone had different questions. Two problems were given and I had-<br/>1. Find sum of data of all leaves of a binary tree on same level and then multiply sums obtained of all levels.<br/>2. Two linked lists are given each containing a positive number find the difference of the two number and store it in a linked list and return reference to the head of the resulting linked list.<br/>Eg: LinkedList1: 6 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 0<br/>LinkedList2: 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 0<br/>Output -&gt; 2 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 0<p>People who solved both and some with one were shortlisted. Results were announced after a month.<br/>25 people were shortlisted after second round and were called to Bangalore.<br/>Many students from different colleges were present for process there.<p><strong>Third round- Group fly.</strong><br/>This was elimination round. Two questions were to be solved in one hour. A mentor was assigned to each group of 8-9 students. We had to discuss our approach and then code it and submit.<br/>1. Remove duplicates from string in place in O(n).<br/>2. Check whether given binary tree is balanced or not. Definition was no two leaves should have height difference of greater than one.<br/>People who solved both were shortlisted.<p><strong>Fourth round \xe2\x80\x93 Technical interview (45 min to 1 hour)</strong><br/>Interviewer was responsive and very co-operative.<br/>First 15 min discussion on my projects. Then he asked me a question on arrays.<br/>Given three arrays(arr1, arr2, arr3) each containing distinct positive numbers find three numbers a,b,c each from arr1, arr2, arr3 respectively such that (abs(a-b) + abs(b-c) + abs(c-a)) is minimum. I gave an nlogn approach for it and then I was to write the code on paper.<br/>Final round was HR<br/>Apart from the HR questions I was asked about to explain Overflow and Underflow Arithmetic Exception and write code to detect it.<br/>Overall experience was very good. The final results were declared 10 days after the interviews got over.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
