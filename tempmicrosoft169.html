How will you do that?<p>Then we had discussion on Red black trees, sharding, redis internals, concept of single threaded applications and event loop .etc.<p><strong>Round 5:</strong><p>This round was based on Behavioral Skills taken by HR team.<p>They asked several situational based questions like if there is some tussle between you and your manager regarding some implementation, how did you tackle that.
