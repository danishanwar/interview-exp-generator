The coding part was pretty simple. 7-8 people were shortlisted for the interview process.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>First face-to-face Interview Round: </strong>The round lasted for an hour. Firstly the interviewer asked me to introduce myself. Later there were 3 coding questions.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s/">Sort an array containing 0s,1s and 2s </a>The interviewer wants you to give the optimized solution. They will help you to optimize the code.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/">Given a 2-dimensional array containing 0s and 1s in ascending order in each row. Find the array which has </a>the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/">most 1s. </a>Firstly I gave 2 solutions for this problem he wanted me to optimize it further.<li>Given a binary tree in which the leaf nodes point to the adjacent leaf nodes and vice versa. Find if the given node is a leaf node or not. This can be solved by traversing the tree and checking if( node-&gt;left-&gt;right==node || node-&gt;right-&gt;left==nod) return true;</li></li></li></ol><p>The selected candidates were called for the next round.<p><strong>Second face-to-face Interview Round: </strong>This round lasted for 1&amp;1/2 hour. Three coding questions were asked.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-tree-from-given-inorder-and-preorder-traversal/">Given inorder and preorder traversal of a tree. Print the actual tree.</a> The interviewer verified it with an example.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inplace-rotate-square-matrix-by-90-degrees/">Rotate a given 2D array by 90 degrees</a>. Again the optimized solution was asked.<li>Given a number and asked the number of ways the number can be obtained as a sum of the natural numbers. I faced some issues coding this. The interviewer helped along the way and it is done using recursion.</li></li></li></ol><p>2 people were selected for the internship from our college.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
