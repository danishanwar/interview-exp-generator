It was totally unexpected referral for me. Me with my friends have already booked tickets to goa because I was not expecting any referral.\xc2\xa0<p>Recruiter sent me the coding test just one week before goa trip, where I have to write code as well as approach and time and space complexity :<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-cost-of-ropes-1587115620/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-cost-of-ropes-1587115620/1</a>. Solved using min heap.<li>https://aonecode.com/amazon-online-assessment-oa2-optimize-memory-usage . Solved using 2 pointer approach, and mentioned binary search approach also.</li></li></ol><p>After passing all the test cases for both of the questions, I was expecting an interview call so I took laptop also with me to goa. I enjoyed first 4 days in goa, on 5th day, Friday , there were three rounds on Amazon Chime<p><strong>Interview Round 1(Hiring Manager Round): </strong>First 40 minutes, we discussed my current company work, university projects, some behavioral questions like conflict with manager, conflict with colleagues etc.<p>Then he asked some tech questions<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Difference between REST and SOAP APIs<li>Producer consumer problem<li>What is virtual memory<li>What is garbage collector, thread vs process.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>I answered all the questions.<p>After First round Lan/WiFi of my Villa stopped working, so I went to the nearest Bar+Restaurant because Bar\xe2\x80\x99s Wi-Fi was working fine.<p><strong>Interview Round 2(DS/Algo Round): Taken by SDE-1</strong><p>In first 10-15 minutes He asked my current company\xe2\x80\x99s work and some behavioral questions. Then he jumped to coding problems<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/level-order-traversal-in-spiral-form/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/level-order-traversal-in-spiral-form/1</a> .I gave two approaches one is using 2 stacks and another is using one deque. I was asked to write code for 2 stack approach.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/value-to-be-subtracted-from-array-elements-to-make-sum-of-all-elements-equals-k/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/value-to-be-subtracted-from-array-elements-to-make-sum-of-all-elements-equals-k/</a> \xc2\xa0.I was told to write a production ready code for all scenarios, solved this problem using binary search approach</li></li></ol><p><strong>Interview Round 3(DS/Algo round): Taken by SDE-2</strong><p>My villa\xe2\x80\x99s wifi started working fine for this round.<p>Interviewer asked me about my day, I told him that I gave second round sitting in a bar, he started laughing and appreciated my spirit. After a short introduction he jumped straight to the coding questions:<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-array-can-be-sorted-with-one-swap/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-array-can-be-sorted-with-one-swap/</a>. First I gave a O(n\xc2\xb2) approach he told me to do it in O(n). I gave a quick approach, but it was failing for some cases, after 5-6 minutes of interactive discussion, I finally gave an approach, and it was working fine for all the cases. He told me to write a production ready code with meaningful variable and function names.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/snake-and-ladder-problem4816/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/snake-and-ladder-problem4816/1</a>. First I told him that it can be solved using DFS or BFS. He told me to solve it using DFS. After trying for sometime I realized using DFS it is falling in \xe2\x88\x9e loop, I tried for 10 minutes but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t solve this using DFS. Then after 5 minutes of interactive discussion he told me that it can be solved using BFS.\xc2\xa0</li></li></ol><p>Next day I returned to my home from goa. after not able to solve snack and ladder problem completely in last round ,I was not expecting next round interview call, but fortunately I was contacted by a recruiter that there is a final round after 5 days.<p><strong>Interview Round 4(DS/Algo Round): Taken by SDE-2</strong><ol><li>Interviewer was 10 min late, and He was the same guy who referred me for this role. After a small discussion he asked me some behavioral questions related to my university projects and current company work, I tried to explain him my current company work that how I am working on <strong>Single Sign On /OIDC protocol . </strong>But couldn\xe2\x80\x99t explain him perfectly.<li>Then he went through my resume and as I am 5* on Codechef, He asked me the most challenging problem I have solved on Codechef, at the time I was completely blank, then I told him about this<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/allocate-minimum-number-of-pages0937/1">( https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/allocate-minimum-number-of-pages0937/1)</a> problem that because of the Codechef I came to know that this can be solved using binary search instead of DP.<li>Then He asked me to Write code for following problem: <a href="" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/palindrome-partitioning-dp-17/</a><li>I wrote the code using this (<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/palindromic-patitioning4845/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/palindromic-patitioning4845/1</a>/)O(n\xc2\xb2) approach.</li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Result : Not Selected</strong>????<strong> , </strong>technically I was good but was not best fit according to amazon leadership principles.<p>Hope this will help others.
