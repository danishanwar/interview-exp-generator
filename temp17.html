You need to answer these questions with care as well as they are equally important for amazon.<p><strong><u>D) APTITUDE &amp; REASONING (35 mins and 24 ques) \xe2\x80\x93 </u></strong>There is enough time and no negative marking, so solve all the questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong><u>INTERVIEWS \xe2\x80\x93</u></strong><p><strong><u>ROUND 1 \xe2\x80\x93 </u></strong>Started with introduction and then we started off with dsa problems<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-height-of-a-special-binary-tree-whose-leaf-nodes-are-connected/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-height-of-a-special-binary-tree-whose-leaf-nodes-are-connected/</a><li>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-weeks-for-which-you-can-work/</li></li></ol><p>The first one was straightforward. For the second, the interviewer gave me hints, i was initially thinking in wrong direction but he helped me to get back on the track and i ended up finding the solution and also coded the same.<p><strong><u>ROUND 2 \xe2\x80\x93 </u></strong>Started with introduction and then we discussed about one of my projects (around 4-5 mins only), and then we moved to dsa questions<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-tour-that-visits-all-stations/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-tour-that-visits-all-stations/</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/</a></li></li></ol><p>Both the questions were standard questions, for the first question, i first started with an O(n^2) approach, then we went to O(n) with extra space and at last i was told to optimize the space as well, so i did it and also coded the space-optimized version. For the second one, i discussed only one approach and was asked to code it.<p><strong><u>ROUND 3 \xe2\x80\x93 </u></strong>Started with introduction, followed by project discussion in-depth, a lot of behavioral type question based on my project and also i was asked to show a working demo of features that i have implemented, after that we were left with 30 \xe2\x80\x93 35 mins, so only one dsa question was asked.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/">lru-cache</a></li></ol><p>I was asked to write the production level code in one go, so i started with my implementation using the concept of classes and was explaining each and every line in detail, after completing the implementation, were some follow up questions about making this code more modular, and then i was asked to find out and rectify the bugs in my code if any, i was only asked to discuss about the rectifications that i can do.<p><strong><u>Note: \xc2\xa0</u></strong>No questions were asked from theory subject like OS, OOPS, DBMS, CN but it totally depends on the interviewer, and you can be asked anything, so don\xe2\x80\x99t ignore these subjects as well.<p><strong><u>TIPS \xe2\x80\x93</u></strong><ol><li>Ask clarifying questions a lot, and always discuss your approach first, don\xe2\x80\x99t jump directly to the coding part.<li>Assume that you can be asked anything from your resume in detail.<li>Thoroughly go through amazon leadership principles as most of the behavioral questions were asked from that only or i can say is you will be judged on these principles in every round.</li></li></li></ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
