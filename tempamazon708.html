But I forgot what were they?<p><strong>Telephonic Interview</strong><br/>Overview of my resume, current role responsibilities and asked to explain internship project in brief.<br/>1. What is the definition of tree ?<br/>2. What are the differences between graph and tree?<br/>3. When can you say a graph to be a tree?<br/>4. Write a program to show whether a graph is a tree or not using adjacency matrix.<br/>Its always good to ask questions at the end. It shows our interest towards the company.<p><strong>F2F 1</strong><br/>Overview of current job responsibilities and internship project.<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/transform-to-sum-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Convert a tree to a sum tree.</a><pre>\r\nExample :\r\n       1                            27\r\n     /   \\                        /   \\\r\n   2       3     -------&gt;       9      13\r\n  / \\     / \\                  / \\     / \\\r\n 4  5    6  7                 0  0    0  0 </pre><p>Always take care of all the corner cases<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pascal-triangle/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print a pascal tree</a> .<br/>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sorted-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a 2D matrix sorted row wise and column wise . Print the matrix in sorted way</a>. (Can be done using Min Heap).<br/>For all the questions, complexity of the program was asked and was being asked to improve both time and space complexity.<p><strong>F2F 2</strong><br/>Many questions regarding my current project, tools and technology I am working on.<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pascal-triangle/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Convert a binary tree to a sum tree . Here he had a new meaning of sum tree.</a><br/>Example :<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><pre>\r\nExample :\r\n       1                            1\r\n     /   \\                        /   \\\r\n   2       3     -------&gt;       2      5\r\n  / \\     / \\                  / \\     / \\\r\n 4  5    6  7                 4   9   15  22 </pre><p>(I did it with Level Order Traversal) (Complete working code was required)<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-largest-elements/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of integers. Find the largest 3 element</a>. (Can be done using Max Heap in less time complexity)<p><strong>F2F 3</strong><br/>Lots of questions on my current work and tools which I was using.<br/>Why do I want to leave my current company on such a short interval of 5 months.<br/>Why Amazon ?<br/>What inspires you to join Amazon? Why dream company ?<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/connect-nodes-at-same-level/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Connect Sibling pointers.</a> I gave a Level Order Traversal solution. He asked to do it in O(1) space complexity. I explained the approach but messed up In writing the working code for that.<br/>2. Explain the approach of <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LRU cache </a>and implement using object oriented language.<p><strong>F2F 4</strong><br/>Why Amazon?<br/>Why do you want to leave your current company in such a short interval?<br/>Did u ask your current company to provide that type of work as u r looking in Amazon?<br/>1. Design a system for finding the costliest element always whenever we pick up an element from a box.(concept of Max Heap)<br/>2. A stream of data is coming. Maintain records in a page and mechanism to see previous and next page. (Concept of Doubly Linked List)<br/>(It is always advisable to ask questions in design questions. The interviewers expect that we will be asking questions for clarification)<br/>What is thread?<br/>What is the meaning of memory leakage?<br/>Followed by many OS questions but I forgot.<br/>In every round , after each question , complexity of the algorithm was asked. Its good to ask questions to get more clarification about the question.<p>I want to thank the entire team of geeksforgeeks. It is a great portal and it helped me a lot in preparing for Amazon interview.<p>Reference \xe2\x80\x93 GeeksForGeeks and Cracking The Coding Interview<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
