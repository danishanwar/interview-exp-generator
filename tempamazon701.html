Its good to point out the problem(s) that are the crux of the question and solving it would lead to the final solution. The interviewers are always very helpful, they give hints whenever required. Just being calm, composed and patient during &amp; between interviews and studying geeksforgeeks will do the work.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
