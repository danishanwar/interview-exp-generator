We had a total of 3 rounds (1 Online Coding on Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s Assessment Portal + 2 Technical Interviews).<p><strong>Round 1: </strong>Online Assessment Round<p>The coding round comprised of 4 sections:<ul><li>Debugging: We had to choose a language and debug up to 10 questions most probably. Codes were very basic like sorting, etc.<li>Coding: There were two medium-hard level questions.<li>Work-style Assessment<li>Aptitude: 25 aptitude questions (most probably)</li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 2: </strong>Technical Interview Round 1<ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-frequency-element/">Next Greater Frequency of Element: </a>same as next greater element but print greater frequency instead. I was asked to write only the function.</li></ul><pre>Eg - 1 1 2 1 3 2  -&gt;  -1 -1 1 -1 1 -1</pre><ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-data-structure-question/">Design a data structure </a>that<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-data-structure-question/"> does insert, delete, max, min </a>deletes<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-data-structure-question/"> max, delete min operations in less time complexity preferred O(1)</a> <strong>(</strong>with duplicate elements<strong>),.</strong>I answered accordingly as given in GFG using a doubly-linked list and min and max heaps. But he asked for a more optimized delete min/max operation in O(1) but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to come up. He explained to me that we could use one more data structure to store addresses of the elements in the heaps. I was asked only the intuition.</li></ul><p><strong>Round 3: </strong>Technical Interview Round 2<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clone-binary-tree-random-pointers/">Clone a Binary tree having random pointers</a> The structure of the node was already provided.<li>Tell me about any technology that you have started learning or have worked on recently \xe2\x80\x93 Use the STAR method to explain. I was from ECE so I was also allowed to speak about any technology which may be related to ECE too.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Tips:</strong><ul><li>Start from brute force and keep on optimizing when asked.<li>Speak while coding or thinking.<li>Repeat the question how you have understood it.<li>Keep track of edge cases.<li>Use STAR method for behavioral questions.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>I guess they didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me any theory as I was from ECE and also not much time was left. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take it for granted, it\xe2\x80\x99s just an assumption of mine.<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Selected<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
