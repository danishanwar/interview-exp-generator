Around 120 candidates were shortlisted for round-1.<p><strong>Round 1: </strong>This round was an online coding round held on AMCAT. It consisted of 4 sections.<ol><li><strong>Code Debug (20 mins): </strong>It had 7 questions which were quite easy.<li><strong>Coding (70 mins):</strong> It consisted of 2 coding questions.<ul><li><p><strong>Question 1: </strong>Merge two sorted linked lists.<li><p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Given a list of N packing crates in the facility, any of which is a candidate to be moved to the new facility. The truck is initially at the origin of capacity M. Return the list of M locations closest to the truck.</p></li></p></li></ul><li><strong>Work Styles Assessment (10-15 mins):</strong> It was based on amazon leadership principles.<li><strong>Logical ability (35 mins):</strong> \xc2\xa0MCQs based on aptitude</li></li></li></li></ol><p>30 candidates were selected for the next round.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2(One-to-One Interview) </strong>We were provided an amazon chime link for the meeting. First of all, the interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself. Then he asked me 2 coding questions.<ol><li><p>Given 2 strings a and b. a represent the first lane in which vehicles move from left to right. The b represents the second lane in which vehicles move from right to left. Vehicles can be B (bike), C (car), T (truck). collision will occur only between two trucks. Find the probability of collision.<p><strong>Example:</strong><pre>a = TCCBCTTB\r\nb = BTCCBBTT\r\ntotal number of collisions=7\r\nProbability of collision = 7/36</pre><p>First I gave the simple solution (time complexity: O(N), space complexity: O(N) ), he told me to write the code and then asked me the optimised approach. So I gave a constant space and linear time complexity algorithm and improved the earlier code.<li><p>Given a binary tree having unique values and an array <i>arr</i> of integers. Return a list of root nodes of every component of the tree after deleting the nodes which are present in arr<i>. </i>I told the O(N) time complexity approach then he asked me to code it. We discussed the edge cases, and I was able to write the full code. He seemed satisfied at this time and asked me to give the brief intro of the project I mentioned in my resume within 30 seconds.\xc2\xa0</p></li></p></p></p></li></ol><p>Then we had a 5-10 minute discussion on the questions I asked him. The interviewer was very friendly.<p>I was expecting to be shortlisted for round-3, but 10 candidates(including me) were offered an internship after the round-2 itself.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
