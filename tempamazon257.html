It consisted of 28 MCQs based on Data structures and algorithms and some output based questions. Difficulty:- Medium to High<p>It also had two programming questions:-<ol><li>Dice Throw Problem<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dice-throw-dp-30/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dice-throw-dp-30/</a><li>Given an unsigned 32 bit integer, find\xc2\xa0 a) leftmost signed bit b) rightmost signed bit c) the total number of signed bits.We have two return a character array containing a#b#c</li></li></ol><p>I was able to solve both questions. After about 7 days, I received a message that I had cleared the test and was called for an interview a week later.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>It was a Face to Face round. The interviewer was friendly. Started off by asking technical introduction, whether I have done any internships or not. Then he jumped right into DS and algorithms.<br/>I was asked two questions in this round and was asked to write code for the same.<ol><li>Iterative PostOrder Traversal Of a Binary Tree.\xc2\xa0 (The interviewer specifically asked me to use only one stack)<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-postorder-traversal-using-stack/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-postorder-traversal-using-stack/</a><li>Printing the maximum length increasing subsequence(length and subsequence both)<br/>He expected the optimized form but I could only write code for\xc2\xa0 O(n^2) approach. I just mentioned about Patience sorting algorithm which can solve this problem in O(N log N) time.</li></li></ol><p>After this question, he asked me whether I have any questions for him. After discussing, he asked me to wait for the result. The HR came and told me that I have to wait for the second round. After about 40 minutes, I was called for the second round.<p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>The interviewer didn\xe2\x80\x99t waste any time and jumped right into DS and algorithms. No questions from resume were asked in this round.<br/>I was asked the following questions:-<ol><li>\xc2\xa0Given an array of n elements, it should satisfy the following property<strong> a &lt; b &gt; c &lt; d &gt; e &lt; f &gt; g\xc2\xa0</strong><br/>I observed that elements at even indices must be lesser than their neighbors while elements at odd indices must be greater. I told him a naive approach of O(N log N)<br/>We could put elements in a maxHeap and then first one by one pop and fill the odd indices first and then the even indices. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied with the complexity.<br/>He wanted O(n) time complexity solution. After thinking for about 5 minutes, I asked him for a hint. (He said bubble sort). I was also thinking about swapping<br/>adjacent elements and got the green signal once I heard this from him.\xc2\xa0 I told him that if the current element doesn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy the rules, we swap it with the next element.<br/>I wrote the code for it and he went through some examples. He was satisfied and moved to the next question.<li>\xc2\xa0He asked me to implement an <strong>LRU</strong> cache (Indirectly)<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/</a><br/>He asked me to implement the mechanism for obtaining three recently played videos for a user such that if a user plays a new video and that is not in the recently played list, the earliest one is removed from this list and this became the latest one. I at once told him that this seems like an LRU cache. He asked me which data structure I would use to solve this problem.<br/>I told him an unordered map with a doubly-linked list. He asked what the map and list would store. After discussing the approach, \xc2\xa0 he asked me to write the code for the insert function.<br/>After I wrote the code, he asked since you have specifically used doubly-linked lists write delete function for a doubly-linked list, given a node pointer.<li>Given a pointer to a Doubly Linked List Node, delete the node.<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-a-node-in-a-doubly-linked-list/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-a-node-in-a-doubly-linked-list/</a><br/>I wrote the code and he asked me to run through some edge cases. The code was correct so he quickly moved on to the next question.<li>\xc2\xa0Design a custom data structure that supports insert, search, delete and getRandom operation in O(1) time.<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/</a><br/>I took some time to think of the approach and gave the approach to him. He even helped me when I got stuck. I told him that an unordered map and a variable-sized array would be good.<br/>He asked me to write the code for the delete function.\xc2\xa0 I wrote the code and he asked me if I am making any mistake. I looked again and found a mistake. I corrected it and then he was satisfied.<li>\xc2\xa0Given a matrix of 0 and X, where 0 represents water and X represents land, find the maximum size of the continuous island. I told him that I would do this by using BFS.<br/>He asked me what Ii will store in the queue and how I will maintain the size of the island. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to write the code for this. He was satisfied just after listening to the approach.After this, he asked me if I had any questions for him. I asked him some questions about work at Amazon. We discussed for about 10-15 minutes and then he said that the interview was over. I knew that this was the last round. The HR told me that they would mail me the result and I shook hands with the interviews before leaving. I got the mail that I am selected as an intern just one day after the Interview.<p>Tip:- Whenever stuck, try discussing the interviewer what you are thinking of and where are you stuck. I got stuck in Question 4 in round 2 in between using a linked list or array. He asked me to focus on the array approach.\xc2\xa0 When that fails, don\xe2\x80\x99t shy to ask for a hint. The interviewer will give you a slight hint and you can build upon that.<p>Verdict: SELECTED!!!</p></p></li></li></li></li></li></ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
