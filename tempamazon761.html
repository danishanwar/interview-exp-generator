Amazon visited our campus for recruitment. Here is my interview experience.<p><strong>Round -1</strong><br/>20 MCQs (C ,Aptitude,DS,DBMS,Networks)<br/>2 programming questions were asked-<br/>1.) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/root-to-leaf-path-sum/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print all root to leaf path of a given binary tree whose path sum is a given value k</a>.<br/>Note: tree was given in the form of array (so no need to create the tree).<br/>Input: Input contains two space separated integers K and L followed by 2^L-1 space separated values<br/>Output: All root to leaf path which has a path sum = k.<br/>Sample Test case :<br/>Input :<br/>40 4 10 11 13 # 15 28 6 # # 8 4 # 9 11 #<br/>Output:<br/>10 11 15 4<br/>10 13 6 11<p>2.) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-intervals/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given few sets of intervals print out the entire intervals without overlapping, if they overlap then combine them into one.</a><br/>Sample test case:<pre>\r\nInput :    (5,7) (1 , 6) (2 ,4) (10 ,14) (8,9) \r\nOutput :   (1,7) (8,9) (10,14) </pre><p><strong>Group fly Round:</strong><br/>2 ques were asked in this round. We were asked to write code on paper very fast.(It was an elimination round.<p>1.) Given a binary tree as below<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><pre>\r\n                               A\r\n                    /    \\\r\n                   B      C\r\n                   /    \\\r\n                   D      E\r\n                     /     /   \\\r\n                    F    G      H </pre><p>Convert the structure of the tree like a left aligned tree whose each node contains a down pointer and a right pointer and looks like the below tree..<pre>\r\n            A\r\n            |\r\n            B \xe2\x80\x93 C\r\n            |\r\n            D\xe2\x80\x94E\r\n            |\r\n            F\xe2\x80\x94G \xe2\x80\x93 H</pre><p>2.)The arrival and departure time of trains are given. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-platforms/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find the minimum number of platforms to accommodate all the trains.</a><pre>\r\nEg.        Arrival     Departure\r\n        7        11\r\n        8        10\r\n        13        14\r\n        4         6\r\nOutput:   2 </pre><p><strong>Round 2. (F2F)</strong><br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/finding-number/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">An array is given in which elements are first monotonically increasing and then decreasing.Search an element in the array</a>. Working code was asked which takes care of all the edge cases. Also asked the time complexity of the code.<p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/queue-using-two-stacks/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Implement queue using 2 stacks .</a><br/>What would be the complexity of enqueue and dequeue operation. I told him O(1) for enqueue and O(n) for dequeue. Then he asked to optimize it. Then he asked the Average case time complexity.<p><strong>Round 3 (F2F)</strong><br/>1. You are given a graph. Write a function to remove all the cycles. Means after the function call the graph must be converted into a connected acyclic graph(tree).<br/>2. What happens when u send an email to someone.<br/>3. What is socket ? What is port?<br/>4. Which protocol is secure for mail transfer? Which protocol is used by Gmail?<br/>5. What is the port number of SMTP?<br/>6. Suppose u open notepad and type something and save it what would happen.<br/>7. What is static member?<br/>8. What is singleton class??<br/>9. If a class has all its members as static would it be a singleton class? Compare them.<br/>10. What is process scheduling? How does it happen? What are various queues maintained by the system? (Where does the scheduler process run ??- This ques was asked in 2nd round of DE Shaw &amp; co).<br/>11. Suppose various process are waiting for a particular resource? What is this situation called? How does the system overcome from this problem?<br/>12. What the various ways of process communication?<br/>13. What is thrashing ?How to overcome from it?<p><strong>Round: 4.)(HR + Technical)</strong><br/>1. Tell me something about yourself<br/>2. A long discussion on project. Brief description. How can you improve it?What changes will make if I ask you to develop it again? Give example of implementation of various oops concept in your project.<br/>3. What is multithreading? Then he said that there are situations where there is no need of multithreading.eg- if I want to add two numbers then no point of using multithreading.So give an example where you can actually implement multithreading. (ANS \xe2\x80\x93 Fibonacci number)<br/>4. Some behavioral questions like-<br/>What are you good at?<br/>What are you proud of?<br/>What are the things you want to change in yourself?etc.<p>5. Various oops concept like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance , etc. with example.<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong><br/>\xe2\x80\xa2 Don\xe2\x80\x99t start writing the code immediately.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2 First tell him the approach .<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2 Take care of all the edge cases.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2 Many times interview may give you hints so make the interview interactive.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2 Very Important \xe2\x80\x93 Don\xe2\x80\x99t focus just on a particular subject like only DS.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2 More or less give time to everything.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2 Study the concepts of OOPS and OS properly.<br/>\xe2\x80\xa2 Have a basic Idea of DBMS and Computer Networks also.<p>All the best.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
