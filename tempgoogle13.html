(Also do not waste time on this)<li>Dry run with an actual case with output side by side<li>While practicing do some competition that will help you to get the clear question because often a question comes with a story and not a very good input or output format, I used Leetcode competitions.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 1: </strong>Technical<ul><li>Write a shuffle for a music player with k iteration of cooldown.

I was grateful that I practiced really well.<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Behavioral (Googlyeness)<p>This round is a little tricky because it seems like they assess how well did you manage your work in the past and how well you will be fit for the team. It was taken by the team manager I was going to join. They discussed quite a lot about the backend technologies I was working on and how did I contribute to my current organization.<p>I did quite well. I prepared for the behavior interview in advance so it was a little smooth for me. For behavior questions, I have prepared these questions beforehand that helped me greatly.<ol><li>How did you resolve any conflicts between your team?<li>Tell me about one time you worked on a project/task and it failed?<li>What is the most challenging project you have worked on?<li>What is the project that you enjoyed most?<li>What is your greatest strength/Weakness?<li>What is the hardest bug that you solved?<li>Why should we hire you?<li>I was asked if you are tech lead and get to know that there is exactly the same project that is done in your organization how would you handle this situation?<li>I told her I will try to merge. There is no wrong or write here, but you need to justify and clear out all the steps you are doing and the basis of what you are taking the decisions along the way. If you have exact experience tell me how did you handle that.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>Also prepared well your intro I was giving multiple interviews in many startups and I curate different intros according to the roles that I am interviewing for !!<p>Hope this helps!!
