Recently, I have been through the interview experience of Amazon India and I would like to share my experience with everyone.<p>Position : SDET<p>No. of Interviews : 1 Written + 4 PI (3 F2F and 1 telephonic)<p>Suggestions : Your code should be optimal, have proper variable naming, consider all corner cases and should not be lengthy.<p><strong>Round 1: (90 minutes)</strong><br/>20 MCQs and 2 coding questions<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Coding questions :<br/>1. A string consists of parenthesis and letters. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/parenthesis-checker/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Write a program to validate all the parenthesis.</a> Ignore the letters.<br/>eg. ((alf)ls) \xe2\x80\x93 valid<br/>)(dkk)() \xe2\x80\x93 invalid<p>2. You are involved in a betting game whose rules are as follows :<br/>a) if you win a round, the bet amount will be added to your sum and next bet amount will be $1;<br/>b) if you lose a round, the bet amount will be reduced from your total sum and next bet will be twice the previous.<br/>c) game ends when all the rounds are complete or you dont have sufficient sum.<br/>Initially, you are given with a string of the form \xe2\x80\x9cWLWWL\xe2\x80\x9d where W indicates a win and L indicates a loss and initial sum. Initial bet amount will be $1.<br/>You need to find the amount at the end of the game.<br/>Function prototypes and main was given for both questions<p><strong>Round 2: (face to face) (1 hour 15 min)</strong><br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a 2d matrix in which rows are sorted in ascending order and columns are also sorted in ascending order .I need to find an element in optimal time complexity</a><p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sorted-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In the same (M X N) matrix I have to print the matrix in increasing order of elements .write code for it(I used heap for that purpose and used concept of merging k sorted array).</a><br/>3. Given an array , each element is one more or one less than its preceding element .find an element in it.(better than O(n) approach)<p>4. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-for-subsequence/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given two strings STR1 and STR2 .we need to find longest substring in STR1 whose all characters are taken from string STR2</a>(was asked to write code for it in optimal time)<pre>\r\n    STR1-abcdefacbccbagfacbacer\r\n    STR2-abc\r\n    ans : length : 7\r\n          acbccba  (from position 7 to 13) </pre><p>5. Given a binary tree. I need to print the nodes in vertical line zigzag manner. For example: 1st vertical line from top to bottom, 2nd vertical line from bottom to top,3rd vertical line from top to bottom and so on<pre>\r\n                       5\r\n                    /     \\\r\n                   3       7\r\n                  / \\     / \\\r\n         1   4   6   8\r\n                    /    \\     \\\r\n          2       9    10</pre><p>Answer would be \xe2\x80\x93<br/>1<br/>2 3<br/>5 4 6<br/>9 7<br/>8<br/>10<p><strong>Round 3: (face to face ) (50-60 minutes)</strong><br/>I was asked about my project in details. He asked me project related questions for first 20 minutes.<br/>Next he asked to convert a binary tree in a doubly link list.<br/>I told him various approaches like by using space complexity and in-place conversion.<br/>I was asked to code all those approaches.<br/>Then he gave a hint about one more approach and asked to code it.<p><strong>Round 4: (face to face) (60-70 minutes)</strong><br/>Again, I was asked about my project in details and he was questioning me on every part of it. Next he asked me to name the subjects that I have studied so far \xf0\x9f\x99\x82 . He asked many theoretical questions on database management systems, SQL, operating systems, OOPs concepts and their real life examples and also two coding questions.<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Code for dfs of a tree</a>(tree can be any general tree)<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pascal-triangle/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print pascal triangle </a>and your output should be same as pascal triangular form (have to consider the space separation) .I told him two approaches and wrote the code.<p><strong>Round 5: (telephonic) (1 hour 30 min)</strong><br/>For first 40 minutes he asked me about my achievements, about amazon company, my project in details and what problems I faced in project and how I resolved them. next he asked one coding question.<br/>1. Find the square root of any number (square root can be a real number) without using any library function .<br/>I told him an approach using Newton-Raphson method. It was faster but he asked simple and optimal method so then i suggested binary search method ( O(log n)) and I was asked to code it and dictate and he ran the code on his system also.<p>Finally, I was hired with three of my friends. \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 \xf0\x9f\x98\x80 :<p>Many many congratulations to the author.
