Platform \xe2\x80\x93 HackerRank.<p><strong>Coding Questions:</strong><p>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/possible-words-from-phone-digits/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print all possible words from phone digits</a><p>2.A question involving optimization using modified binary search(I do not remember the entire question).<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>A total of 10 students were selected after this round. The aptitude were simple but coding questions were time-consuming.<p><strong>Second Round(technical):</strong><p>The interviewer asked me three questions one after another.<p><strong>First question:</strong><p>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/permutations-of-a-given-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">print all permutations of a given string.</a><p>The interviewer asked me the approach only.<p>2.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/spirally-traversing-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">print a matrix in spiral order.</a><p>The interviewer asked me directly to code.<p>3.print the <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/left-view-of-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">left </a>and <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/right-view-of-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right view</a> of a binary tree.<p>The interviewer asked me the approach but did not tell me to code.<p>It was an easy round and 5 students were selected for Third round.<p><strong><br/>Third Round(Technical):</strong><p>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-spaces/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Write a program to remove the whitespaces from a given string.</a><br/>First i told him in o(n) time complexity and o(n) space complexity approach but he wanted o(n) time complexity with constant space complexity. I was unable to do it so he asked me second question.<p>2.Write a program to find the element which is common in all the rows in a two-dimensional array. I told him using binary search but he wanted more optimized approach but i was unable to do so.<p>I did not get selected but Overall it was a good interview experience.<p>I want to thank geeksforgeeks for such a good and amazing solutions to the back-breaking problems which helped me in the interview .<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
