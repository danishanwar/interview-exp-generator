(around 10!)<p>1)Given n (no. of elements of array){1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} , K (no of elements in one row or column as specified)(eg. 3)<br/>and A boolean variable Col &amp; Row. When Col =True We have to print elements of array like-<br/>1 4 7<br/>2 5 8<br/>3 6<br/>And when row= True<br/>1 2 3<br/>4 5 6<br/>7 8<p>2)Assume a computer screen.All the pixels are colored black.

Every interview felt like a simple peer to peer conversation.<br/>All i would suggest is Geeks For Geeks And u need Nothing to do \xf0\x9f\x98\x80<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
