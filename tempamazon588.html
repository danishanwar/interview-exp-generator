I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the exact problem statement, but it was pretty standard one and required a DFS+DP solution.<p><strong>Round One (Telephonic)</strong><br/>1)<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximize-number-of-1s/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given an array of zeroes and ones. You are allowed to flip any one 0 so as to maximize the continuous number of one\xe2\x80\x99s.</a><p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given only a Node of a Binary Tree, Find the next in-order successor</a> in O(1) space. Root of tree is unknown.<br/>As he told to assume anything except the position of root, To solve the problem I assumed that the Treenodes also contain parent pointers to their respective parent.<p><strong>Round Two (F2F)</strong><br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-a-binary-tree-in-vertical-order/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a Binary Tree. Print its elements vertically. Solved it using Horizontal Distance concept and hashmap.</a><p>2) Variation of above question, you are not allowed to use Hashmap. Discussed many approaches. He applied a constraint of not using any Hashing, after a lot of discussion and variations came up with the solution as a Doubly Linked List of List of Nodes. Since I was not allowed to use hashing, the variation I did to solve was to maintain a global pointer to the doubly linked list, moved it left in doubly linked list for the left child of current treenode and move right for right child of current tree-node.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong><br/>Round Three (F2F)</strong><br/>Introduction and Internship related discussion followed by these technical problems<br/>1) Given a Stream of sorted integers. Size of input vector is unknown. Find a given integer. Expected Complexity; Log(n)<br/>Hint: Used Perfect Square\xe2\x80\x99s as the start index and end index in binary search approach.<br/>2) Variation in above problem, as we do not know the end point. Lets assume we have a function which returns NULL if the threshold index (Size of input vector)<br/>had crossed. Now improve above solution to handle the case.<br/>Ex: Lets assume that the array size is<br/>3) Subject Related Questions: TCP v/s UDP, Virtual memory, Cryptography etc<br/>4) Design a Music Player which plays songs in random order without repeat. Came with O(n) Time and O(1) space solution.<p><strong>Round Four (F2F)</strong><br/>Introduction, Project related questions followed by:<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-k-sorted-linked-lists/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given k sorted Linked Lists. combine those into one sorted list.</a><br/>Used custom Min heap approach to do the same.<br/>2) Implement Custom Min Heap for above problem.<br/>3) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nodes-at-given-distance-in-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print Nodes at distance \xe2\x80\x9ck\xe2\x80\x9d from a given node in a binary tree.</a><p><strong>Round Five (Telephonic)</strong><br/>1) Introduction and Project discussion.<br/>2) Convert given integer into Roman Number format but by using minimum number of conditional statements. Came up with lot of approaches,<br/>he was not satisfied with any approach and asked to remove as much conditional statements as I can.<br/>3) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-subarray-of-0s-and-1s/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of zeroes and ones. find the maximum size of subarray with equal number of zeroes and ones.</a> Came up with O(n) time and O(n) space solution.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
