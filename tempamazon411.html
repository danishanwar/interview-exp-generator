And there were only 2 technical Interviews.<p>In my First Interview Round Interviewer asked me followings:<ol><li>Tell Me about yourself.<li>Then he gave me\xc2\xa0 coding questions.Given a\xc2\xa0<strong>B</strong>inary\xc2\xa0<strong>S</strong>earch\xc2\xa0<strong>T</strong>ree (BST), modify it so that all greater values in the given BST are added to every node.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-all-greater-values-to-every-node-in-a-bst/1">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-greater-values-every-node-given-bst/</a>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0.<strong>I asked the interviewer that what about the Integer limits while adding. and this made a quite good impression on him.</strong><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reverse words in Given String.</a>Example: Let the input string be \xe2\x80\x9ci like this program very much\xe2\x80\x9d. The function should change the string to \xe2\x80\x9cmuch very program this like i\xe2\x80\x9d.<p>But the string is not stored in Normal Character Array. <em>Here each character is a node in Linked List (including\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0space too).</em><li><header class="entry-header"></header><div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Then he asked me about LRU Cache. and asked about How it is Implemented</a>. i was not able to answer quite correctly but somehow i came up with Linked List approach.<p>This round lasted about 45 minutes.I was asked to write code on Paper.
