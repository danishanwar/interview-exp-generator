And there were 2 coding questions \xc2\xa0<ul><li>One simple question based on the array.<li>Second based on Dynamic Programming <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/" target="_blank">Number of ways to get a given sum with n number of m faced dices</a>.</li></li></ul><p>Both the coding question needed to be solved to proceed for the interview.<p>Based on my performance in the written test and maybe my resume they had selected me to interview for the System Dev Intern.<p><strong><u>Interview Round -1</u></strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>The interviewer went through my resume. Without wasting any time he said let\xe2\x80\x99s move into coding. He told me that first he would explain/write the question. Then I will have to tell my approach and then after the approach in final, I will write down the working code in an A4 size paper.<p>Question- \xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/" target="_blank">Search an element in a sorted and rotated array</a><p>I told him about the approach to find the pivot using binary search and then apply binary search in two half to find the element. He told me if I can find the pivot using binary search then I can also find the element without finding the pivot. I got stuck at this moment. Then I asked him for a hint he said you have the first element in the array, last element and the middle element how you can use it, using this I was able to solve and write the working code in the paper.<p>Why I used mid= start +(end-mid)/2 ? \xc2\xa0(to avoid overflow!)<p>Time Complexity of the program was asked. ( O(log n))<p>Then he asked me some questions related to my project, internships and all went fine.<p><strong>Interview Round -2</strong><p>The interviewer started that your projects and internships were discussed by the previous interviewer lets start with coding. He asked a simple character count program but basically wanted to know about my knowledge about STL i.e use of Map.<p>The main interview started with questions from subjects<ul><li>Basic shell commands like cd, pwd and also asked me grep, cut commands as had done shell scripting before in my project.<li>Operating system related question, scheduling<li>What happens when I write a URL and press enter in the browser.<li>Networking related questions like TCP and UDP<li>He gave me some example and asked which protocol is used here.<li>And some scenarios which one should we use and why?<li>When should we increase the number of servers and when we should increase the performance of servers. (Vertical and Horizontal scaling)</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>That\xe2\x80\x99s all at the end of the day I was selected.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
