There were 3 rounds totally which are described below,<p><strong>First Round (Online Test): </strong>This round is an online test which consisted of 4 sections namely Coding MCQ, Problem Solving using data structures, Behaviour questions, Logical Reasoning. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<ol><li><strong>Coding MCQ </strong>is really easy if you have knowledge in control statements, logic change in a part of code (Eg. To find sum of digits).\xc2\xa0<li><strong>Problem Solving using data structures </strong>consists of 2 coding questions to be solved in 90 minutes, both problems were of medium difficulty mainly based on binary search, linked list, trees, graphs. Try to cover all the test cases and pass them. Have an eye on the time to complete both problems in 90 minutes.\xc2\xa0<li><strong>Behaviour questions </strong>consists of around 30 behaviour questions with 4 options, you have to pick the appropriate decision you would pick for the given situation. <i>For Example, If you feel stuck at your work what would you do? a. Reach out to a team member immediately b. Reach out to a team member after trying myself for some time. </i>Try to answer responsibly for every question.<li><strong>Logical Reasoning </strong>consists of some aptitude questions. You get enough time to work out and answer the questions.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>Don\xe2\x80\x99t get nervous at any section, try to utilise each and every minute!!<p><strong>Second Round (Technical Interview 1 \xe2\x80\x93 60 mins): </strong>In this round, I was asked 2 Data Structure questions (N-ary tree and binary heap). I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the questions but both the questions were of medium difficulty you can search for them in GeeksforGeeks.\xc2\xa0<ul><li>The interviewer will definitely help wherever you get stuck.\xc2\xa0<li>Remember to clarify relevant doubts before you approach a problem.\xc2\xa0<li>Share your thought process continuously on how are you going to approach the problem.\xc2\xa0<li>Keep your explanation precise and try to optimise the approach by calculating time and space complexities.\xc2\xa0<li>If interviewer does not get satisfied, try to think alternative approaches.\xc2\xa0<li>Whichever solution impresses the interviewer, implement that solution and try to cover all possible test cases by doing a dry run for the test cases. No theory questions were asked in this round.\xc2\xa0</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Third Round (Technical Interview 2 \xe2\x80\x93 60 mins): </strong>In this round, there were questions from my interests that I have put in my resume(Eg. Explain ACID properties in DBMS).\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li>Also, I explained the projects that I have put in my resume and I gave an overview of what I did in the project, what I learned throughout the project development.\xc2\xa0<li>Then they asked 2 data structure questions (binary search and tree). I got stuck at some places, but the interviewer was so friendly to set me up in the right direction.\xc2\xa0<li>Discuss with the interviewer at regular intervals. The rest of this interview is similar to Technical Interview 1.<li>I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t point out the problems that were asked in my interviews because it was completely new and unable to find them in any coding portal. You can look other\xe2\x80\x99s Amazon interview experiences in GeeksforGeeks to get an idea for the level of problems asked in Amazon. You will find a similar pattern of problems and prepare for them as well.</li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Tips to crack the above rounds</strong> :<p><strong>First Round</strong>: Candidates will be filtered heavily in this round.\xc2\xa0<ul><li>So, utilize the time properly.\xc2\xa0<li>Try to cover most of the test cases in coding questions by optimizing the solution.\xc2\xa0<li>Answer responsibly for the behavior questions. a\xc2\xa0</li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Second and Third Rounds</strong>: In the interviews, only if you can able to solve both the coding questions you will be considered.\xc2\xa0<ul><li>Try to give multiple approaches to a problem.\xc2\xa0<li>Know to calculate time and space complexities for the solution especially for the recursive solutions.\xc2\xa0<li>Implement your solution in your preferred language and cover all the possible test cases. Optimization is must!.\xc2\xa0<li>Try to give as many data points by discussing with the interviewer. Try to finish of each problem before 30 minutes (Telling approach, Optimising approach, Implementing approach). Finally, show your interest in the company by asking relevant questions at last.\xc2\xa0</li></li></li></li></ul><p>I was able to get selected for the 6-months internship.
