It was 75 minutes long and had three<br/>coding questions.</ol></p><li><strong>Q1:</strong> Given a Linked List of integers, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segregate-even-and-odd-elements-in-a-linked-list/">write a function to modify the linked list in-place such that all odd numbers appear before all the even numbers in the modified linked list.</a> The relative order of even and odd numbers should remain the same.<br/>For Example:<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 1-&gt;8-&gt;2-&gt;10-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;7-&gt;6-&gt;NULL\r\n<strong>Output:</strong> 1-&gt;5-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;2-&gt;10-&gt;4-&gt;6-&gt;NULL\r\n</pre><li><strong>Q2:</strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-a-perfect-square/"> Given a floating point number, calculate its square root without using in-built sqrt() function.</a><li><strong>Q3:</strong> Given a pattern string and a test string, implement RegEx substring matching. If the pattern is\xc2\xa0preceded by a ^, it will match with the starting position. Similarly, if it is preceded by a $, it will match\xc2\xa0the ending position. If no such markers are present, it will check whether pattern is a substring of test.<br/>For Example:<pre>^coal\r\ncoaltar\r\nResult: True\r\n$tar\r\ncoaltar\r\nResult: True\r\nabcd\r\nefgh\r\nResult: False\r\n</pre><p>Around 50 people qualified for the next round. From a total of 40 test cases across the three problems,\xc2\xa0successfully passing 20 test cases ensured qualification. All three problems had tricky, hidden edge cases\xc2\xa0and very few candidates could pass all the test cases in even one problem.<p><strong>Round 2</strong>\xe2\x80\x93 Pen and Paper Round: Two coding questions were given whose solution was to be submitted\xc2\xa0on pen and paper. A total of 45 minutes was allocated for this round:<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><strong>Q1:</strong> Rotate a square image 90\xc2\xa0degree\xc2\xa0clockwise<br/><strong>Similar Question</strong>: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inplace-rotate-square-matrix-by-90-degrees/">GeeksforGeeks Link.</a><li><strong>Q2:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-a-and-a-number-x-check-for-pair-in-a-with-sum-as-x/">Given an array of integers and a target sum, write a function to check whether there exists a pair of\xc2\xa0integers whose sum equals the target</a>. Use extra space to reduce the time complexity as much as\xc2\xa0possible.<p>A total of 17 students qualified from this round.</p></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3-\xc2\xa0Personal Interview 1:</strong> This was a technical round. There was a brief discussion on interests and\xc2\xa0project followed by two coding questions:<ol><li><strong>Q1:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/">Write a function to reverse the order of the words in a string</a><br/>My initial solution had a small bug, which I fixed later on.<li><strong>Q2:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-every-k-th-node-linked-list/">Given a linked list and an integer n, write a function to remove every nth node from the list.</a><pre>For Example, 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;NULL n=3;\r\nResult: 1-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;NULL</pre></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4</strong>\xe2\x80\x93 <strong>Personal Interview 2:</strong> This was the second technical round. A brief discussion on coursework\xc2\xa0was followed by three coding questions.<ol><li><strong>Q1:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/root-to-leaf-path-sum-equal-to-a-given-number/">Given a binary tree and a target sum, return all the root-to-leaf paths which have the target sum.</a>\xc2\xa0After solving this, the interviewer asked for some cases which could be used to test whether the code\xc2\xa0was working perfectly or not. Once he was satisfied, he modified the problem and now wanted to check\xc2\xa0whether any node-to-leaf path had the target sum. I briefly discussed my approach and it was good\xc2\xa0enough.<li><strong>Q2:</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-print-substrings-given-string/">Given a string of length n, generate all possible substrings of the string.</a> I initially misunderstood the\xc2\xa0problem, thinking all the 2n\xc2\xa0possible combinations of the string. Seeing the solution to this, the\xc2\xa0interviewer said that I am overcomplicating the solution and explained the problem once again. He\xc2\xa0seemed happy with the final solution I gave.<li><strong>Q3:</strong> Imagine you have to build an API which would allow customers to book a hotel from all the available\xc2\xa0ones. How would you approach the problem and what data structures would you use for each\xc2\xa0functionality. It was an OOP problem and he was looking for a class design which could enable a\xc2\xa0customer to view hotel details and book one hotel.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 5- Personal Interview 3:</strong><ol>This was the HR round. There was a detailed conversation regarding the\xc2\xa0project followed by basic questions.</ol></p><li>He asked me what books I had read and what was the toughest\xc2\xa0assignment I had completed in college and what were the problems I faced during it.<li>After this, he asked\xc2\xa0me what would be the optimal way to search an element in an array. It was a rather vague question and\xc2\xa0I answered that for smaller arrays, linear search would be efficient enough but binary search would be\xc2\xa0more efficient for larger arrays.\xc2\xa0<li>Then I was asked to implement a library system which could allow anyone to issue or return a book and\xc2\xa0find the corresponding dues left. He kept adding certain functionalities as time went on which were to\xc2\xa0be implemented by modifying the classes as per the needs.<p>In the end, a total of 5 candidates were selected for MS-IDC and 3 for MS-IT.<p>All in all, it was a memorable experience for me. The entire procedure from start to end was carried out\xc2\xa0very professionally and the interviewers were friendly and supportive. They were more interested in\xc2\xa0looking at how a candidate could practically apply the concepts he/she knew instead of seeing how\xc2\xa0many diverse concepts he/she is aware of.<br/>My suggestions for other candidates would be to keep their cool during the process and to maintain\xc2\xa0their self-belief at all times. Keep your basics strong and learn to develop solutions from scratch instead\xc2\xa0of remembering several difficult algorithms. Providing correct approaches and thinking clearly matters\xc2\xa0more than actually giving the perfect solution.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
