They asked me to write code for each and every question. They are also checking how good your variable names are and your coding style. They want each and every solution to be optimised in both space and time complexity. Remember that O(2N) is not equal to O(N) for them and also for most of the other companies. They need it in one traversal. Total of 9 students out of 50 was selected. With the help of Geeks for Geeks, I also got selected for the Internship.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
