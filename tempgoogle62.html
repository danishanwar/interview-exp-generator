The program is basically for women who wish to pursue a career in software engineering. It was first launched in 2019 and the students who were in the 3rd and 4th year of their engineering batch could take part in it.<p>TalentSprint organized a 1year program for 100 talented women engineers of the country. It would train the women through boot camps and online learning sessions and also provide them with placement opportunities at the end of the year. The candidates would also receive Rs 1, 00, 000 cash scholarship. The news regarding this program came up in various reputed newspapers and we were also informed about it in school.<p>For the selection process, we had an online proctored examination which had a number of sections. The first three sections had a number of aptitude-based questions. The fourth section had questions related to programming skills where we had to spot the error and predict the output of a code snippet. The difficulty level was moderate and being a Computer Science student, it was not much difficult for me to solve the questions.<p>The students who qualified for the test was called for an online interview. In the interview, I was asked a number of questions related to data structure and algorithms. My coding skills were also tested. In the HR round, I was asked questions related to my hobbies and career goals. After 2 weeks, I received a mail saying that I was qualified for the program. I was absolutely elated and reached Hyderabad for the cohort on 31st May 2019.<p>This year also, TalentSprint is going to organize the WE Program and the interested candidates must not miss this opportunity as it is a great platform to boost your career and get the job of your dreams.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
