Then he told me to optimise it, I gave him solution using min_heap and max_heap. He seems to satisfy, and he told me to code it.<p>2) He gave me a tree and ask me to print its different views.

A manager can have a different number of employees who are working under him. Now, this employee can have a different number of workers who are working under that employee. This can be up to any level.<p>He told me to find the youngest common manager of two workers.<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Basically it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem of finding a common ancestor in the n-array Tree. Firstly I created an n array tree then gave him 2 approaches\xc2\xa0<ul><li>Using recursion<li>First, find the path from the root to that worker and then compare the path and check the node just before the first mismatching node.</li></li></ul><p style="text-align:justify">2) <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lexicographically-previous-permutation-in-c/">How to find Lexicographically previous permutation?</a><p>3) Maximum Profit using at-most k-transaction<p>https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/<p>I gave him 2 solutions first one was using recursion and top-down approach and the 2nd one was using the bottom approach.<p>\xc2\xa0Finally, the result declared after 10 days and two students were selected for the internship.
