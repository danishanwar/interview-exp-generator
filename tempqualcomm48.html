Relocation? salary expectation? just a casual talk.<br/>Note: All rounds, you need to explain about your project clearly and they can ask some really good questions from your project. Be out and out clear with your projects and CV.<p>After this, I was actually into my Dream Company and Happy..!!<p>I suggest that always listen carefully to an interviewer, they\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely help if you have any doubt. Tell them your approach at least if you are not able to code it. Practice writing code on paper. For Qualcomm <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/c-arrays/">Arrays</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/linked-list/">Linked Lists</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/c-strings/">Strings</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/tree/">Trees</a> are concepts which are very generally asked. Data structures &amp; algorithms, OS should be proficiently practiced.<p>I would sincerely Thank <strong>GeeksforGeeks </strong>very helpful in my preparation and hope this would be useful for other aspirants.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
