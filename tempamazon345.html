Was asked to do it in constant space. I was able to do it by taking two pointers.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2.\xc2\xa0 <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-product-subarray/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Maximum product Sub-array</a><p>3.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nodes-at-given-distance-in-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print nodes at a distance k from a given node.</a> As a follow-up, was asked to print the nodes in sorted order.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>Two questions were asked in this round.<br/>1)<br/>Given an n-ary tree, it consists of some bad nodes and good nodes. Nodes having value 1 are good and nodes with value 0 are bad. Problem was to count all root to leaf paths having less than K bad nodes.<p>Suggested a bottom up recursive approach. Interviewer was convinced but told me a top-down approach would have been an easier approach<p>2.\xc2\xa0 <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LRU cache</a><p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>This was again a problem solving round only and 4 questions were asked.<p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Search in a row wise and column wise sorted matrix</a><p>2.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-ways-to-reach-the-nth-stair/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Count ways to reach the n\xe2\x80\x99th stair such that you are allowed to take only 1 or 2 stairs at a time.</a><p>3) Find distance between leftmost leaf to rightmost leaf. I was told that by the interviewer that he will change the requirement and my code should be able to accommodate the changes.<p>Initially wrote a normal code counting the nodes from root to leftmost leaf and root to rightmost leaf. But he said he now wants to print the path. So wrote a recursive solution and interviewer was happy with the solution.<p>4) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/triplet-sum-in-array/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find 3 numbers in an array such that their sum is closest to a given number X.</a> Sum can be less OR\xc2\xa0 more than X i.e absolute difference is to be considered.<p>After 3 rounds the HR told me that I had cleared all 3 rounds and 4th round will be a video call which will happen in a couple of weeks.<p><strong>Round 4:\xc2\xa0</strong><p>This was a Bar-raiser round and was taken by a senior person.<p>1) Initially was asked to introduce myself.<br/>2) Then I was to explain my internship project and then a few counter questions over it.<br/>3)\xc2\xa0Two problem-solving questions which I had to code on a code-pair sort of a platform wherein the interviewer was able to see my code. These were the two questions :<br/>a) A variant of <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-k-sorted-arrays/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge k sorted arrays </a>problem.<br/>b) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delete all duplicate nodes in an unsorted linked list.</a> Do this in one pass.<p>4) Why Amazon?<p>5) Did you ever face any issue in your internship project and how did you solve it?<p>With this round, the interview process was over. I got a call from the HR after a couple of days telling that the feedback was positive and I was hired \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p>Thank you GeeksforGeeks for all the invaluable content. If you have solved enough problems on GeeksforGeeks, the interview should not be a problem at all.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
