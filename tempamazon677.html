Hope this will help others:<p><strong>Written Round :</strong><br/>there where 3 coding question , out of which 2 where DS related and 3 rd one was Problem solving<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-number-of-words/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Count no of words in given string</a> .<br/>2.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Find first non repeating character in a stream of characters</a><br/>3. related to slot machine and its working<p>Interviews<br/><strong>F2F 1.</strong><br/>1. firstly some non technical questions where there , such as<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 tell me about yourself ,<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why Amazon etc<br/>2. followed by 2 coding questions<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/alien-dictionary/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a sorted dictionary of alien language , find order of characters.</a><br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/form-a-palindrome/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">find minimum number of characters needed to be added to the end of a string to make it palindrome</a>.<p><strong>F2F 2.</strong><br/>was a senior guy ,<br/>1.started with discussion on previous interview questions , as I had used DP in second question so a brief discussion on DP , tried to test me that does I really know the concept of DP.<br/>2. asked few puzzles , One should be prepared for some out of box questions as they want to check the thought process . even they change puzzles and try to get different solutions. Think loud always.<p><strong>F2F 3.</strong><br/>was also a senior guy,<br/>1. Started with general induction and asked about till then my interview experience and related stuff.<br/>2. Simple Matrix multiplication problem ,with only 2 double pointer are given , we need to check sizes of both matrix , multiplication feasibility and then do multiplication .<br/>3. Design Question from DataBase point of view , asked about table structure for the problem and had a good discussion on it , concept such as normalisation was discussed .<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Telephonic 4th</strong><br/>He was a very senior guy from different team ,<br/>1. Started with general introduction followed by many Behavioural hr questions .<br/>2. Followed by Design Question, a feature of Outlook<br/>A Server receives meeting objects from multiple senders. Meeting object contains meeting time, sent time, recipient(s), sender id,etc. When recipient comes and checks the server, he/she should get requests based on meeting time and not based on sent time. Many discussions on space complexity and time complexity.?Eg:<p>12 PM From: A To: B,C,D meeting time: 4 PM meeting Id: 1<p>12.30 PM from: A To C,D meeting time : 2 PM meeting Id:2<p>1:PM From B To: C meeting time: 1.30PM meeting Id:3<p>When C requests the server, C should get ID3 as 1st, ID2 as 2nd and ID1 as 3rd meeting.<p><strong>Small set of Suggestions :</strong><br/>1. Practice writing code using pen and paper .<br/>2. Try to be interactive as they are very much interested in candidate\xe2\x80\x99s thought process , think loud , be confident .<br/>3. Firstly explain the logic and when interviewer is satisfied then start coding .<br/>4. Have few questions prepared for the interviewer as it shows interest of candidate towards the company .Do proper home work about the company.<p>Thanks GeeksforGeeks for such a great content , Keep doing the great work \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p>\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
