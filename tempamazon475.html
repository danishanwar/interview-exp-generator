I\xe2\x80\x99m sharing my internship interview experience.<br/>There were 3 rounds in all \xe2\x80\x93 1 Online Round followed by 2 F2F Interviews.<br/><strong>Online Round(90 min on Hackerearth):</strong><p>There were 20 questions mostly based on C, C++, DS, Reasoning and a few from OS, OOPS, DBMS etc and 2 coding questions.<br/>The 2 coding questions were:<ol><li>Find the maximum sum of lengths of non-overlapping contiguous subarrays with k as the maximum element.<pre>\r\nEx: Array: {2,1,4,9,2,3,8,3,4} and k = 4\r\nAns: 5\r\n{2,1,4} =&gt; Length = 3\r\n{3,4} =&gt; Length = 2\r\nSo, 3 + 2 = 5 is the answer\r\n</pre><p><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-lengths-of-non-overlapping-subarrays/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>You are given an array A where A[i] (1-based indexing) denotes the number of chocolates corresponding to each station. When we move from station i to station i+1 we get A[i] \xe2\x80\x93 A[i+1] chocolates for free. Note that if this number is negative, we lose that many chocolates. We can only move from station i to station i+1 and that too if and only if we have non-negative number of chocolates with us. Given that cost of one chocolate is Rs. P , our task is to find the minimum cost incurred in reaching station n from the first station (station 1).<pre>\r\nEx: A: {1,2,3} and P = 10 Ans: 30\r\nTo reach station 1 from the starting station, we need to buy 1 chocolate.To reach station 2 form station 1, we get A[1] \xe2\x80\x93 A[2] = -1 chocolates i.e. we lose 1 chocolate. Hence, we need to buy 1 chocolate.Similarly, we need to buy 1 chocolate to reach station 3 from station 2.Hence, total cost incurred = (1+1+1)*10 = 30.\r\n</pre><p><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/chocolate-station/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></p></li></p></li></ol><p><strong>Out of around 150 students, 26 were shortlisted for Round 2.</strong><p>-&gt; In the 1st question those who used cin/cout instead of printf/scanf got TLE in 20% of test cases.<p>-&gt;In the 2nd question not a single test case was passed on using int instead of long long int. I wasted about 40 mins on this.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>-&gt;Doing MCQ was important. Few students who solved both the coding question but didn\xe2\x80\x99t attempt the MCQs were not selected while some who could solve 80% of 1 question(8/10 test cases) and few MCQs were selected.<p><strong>Round 2: FTF Interview (Around 30 mins):</strong><ol><li>The interviewer told me to introduce myself.<li>Count all nodes at distance k from a given node in a binary tree. It\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nodes-at-given-distance-in-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print nodes at k distance from a given node</a> .<br/>Suddenly he went out of the room and came after about 20 mins.By that time I came up with the O(n) solution, I explained it to him with a pseudo code.<p>Then, he asked me if I had any questions for him.</p></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3: FTF Interview (Around 45 minutes):</strong><p>First, the interviewer told me to introduce myself and then asked me the question asked in the 1st round. Then, she asked me about threading.I told her that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t studied JAVA well. Thereafter she didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask anything related to JAVA.<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Search in row and column wise matrix</a> I started with an O(RlogC) ssolution,she told me to optimize it , after some time I finally gave the O(R+C) solution.She asked me to write the code.<li>A stream of integers are coming you need to keep the track of minimum at any time, which DS would you use? I told her that I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply store the numbers in a vector and keep a variable min and update min whenever required. Then she told me what if you need to find Kth minimum. I told her to explain the question again , then she asked <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-largest-elements/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kth largest or smallest element in an array</a>. We discussed various approach. She asked me to code the Max-heap approach(use of STL was allowed).Then she asked me various questions about heap.<li>How to represent heap efficiently? I told her the array representation, then she asked me to explain the one using pointers. After that, she asked me which one is better and why? I listed various reasons one of which was that array is cache friendly, she asked me to elaborate this.She also asked me few questions on cache.<li>She asked me to explain heap sort in detail.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/heap-sort/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><br/>We discussed it for about 5 min covering everything in detail. Code was not required.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-cost-of-ropes/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Connect N ropes with minimum cost</a>Initially my approach was wrong, she showed a case where it failed . After some time i told her O(N*N) approach which was correct, she asked me to optimize it and told me to think of some DS which i can use.Finally, I came up with the solution using heap, she asked me to code it.</li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>Finally, she asked if I had any questions for her. My experience of this round was very good, the interviewer was very helpful and friendly.<p>Out of the 26 selected for the interviews, 13 were finally selected for internship.<p>During my preparation geeksforgeeks, indeed, was a great help. Almost all questions asked in the interview were from geeks. A big thank you to other geeks as well for sharing their interview experiences as going through past experiences was the perfect way to end my preparations.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
