It was a 2-3 minute formal introduction and went straight to the coding question.<li>You are tasked to develop a simple search engine that also takes care of correcting the spelling mistakes and shows the words matching the given work in the dictionary.

I was asked to optimize.<li>I shared a little optimized approach. The interviewer was expecting the most optimized solution.<li>Finally, I told the trie data structure solution, and then I was asked to code it.<li>I started coding the solution in the live coding environment and had a continuous talk with the interviewer discussing various edge cases and possibilities. He helped me a lot and was very friendly.<li>I\xe2\x80\x99m linking a GFG article for reference but the solution needs to be modified: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/">Trie-Insertion-and-search.</a><li>We then made a dry run through the code and found a bug and fixed it and also discussed Complexities.<li>This took so much time, the interviewer was satisfied with the code and asked me if I have any questions.<li>I was asked only one question but some of my friends were asked 2-3 questions in total.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3 (F2F Technical Interview): </strong>This was also held on Amazon Chime (A video calling platform) and the interview lasted for 1 hour.

He directly headed towards the coding questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><strong>Asteroid Collision </strong>( https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/ )<br/>We are given an array of asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.<br/>For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.<br/>Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.<ul><li>Started asking questions to clarify doubts on constraints.<li>In a usual way first I shared a brute force approach and gave time and space complexities.

Find this single element that appears only once.<ul><li>I shared the brute force approach and was asked to optimize.<li>I gave 2 more approaches that were not the most optimized.<li>Later I gave Binary Search Modification but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t complete the code and was stuck confused wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to figure out what was going wrong.<li>After a while, the interviewer asked me to switch to another question.</li></li></li></li></ul><li><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-numbers-formed-root-leaf-paths/"><strong>Sum of all the numbers that are formed from root to leaf paths</strong></a><br/>You are given a binary tree, where every node value is a digit (0 \xe2\x80\x93 9). Find the sum of all the numbers which are formed from root to leaf paths.<br/>For example, consider the following Binary Tree.<pre>\r\n       6\r\n     /  \\\r\n    3    5\r\n  /   \\   \\\r\n 2     5   4  \r\n      /  \\\r\n     7    4</pre><ul><li>I shared a solution and the interviewer asked me to explain the question asked.<li>I was tensed for not finishing the previous code and misunderstood the question and gave an approach.<li>Later I asked questions to clarify my doubts.<pre>There are 4 leaves, hence 4 roots to leaf paths:\r\nPath                    Number\r\n6-&gt;3-&gt;2                   632\r\n6-&gt;3-&gt;5-&gt;7               6357\r\n6-&gt;3-&gt;5-&gt;4               6354\r\n6-&gt;5&gt;4                    654\r\nAnswer = 632 + 6357 + 6354 + 654 = 13997 </pre><li>I shared an approach and coded it which had bugs.<li>Time was up and the interviewer asked me to stop and asked if I have any questions.</li></li></li></li></li></ul></p></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Result: </strong>Unfortunately, I did not clear the interview. Only 2 students were selected out of 16.<p><strong>Tips:</strong><ol><li>Before jumping into the solution, carefully listen and understand the question properly, and avoid any assumptions regarding the problem. Ask doubts and clarify every detail of the question.<li>Stay calm, positive, and focussed during the interview. (Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk with peers before the interview)<li>Be clear with your approach and try to consider all possible edge/corner cases.<li>Try to familiarize yourself with the time and space complexity of every part of your approach.<li>Be confident. If you are stuck somewhere the interviewer usually helps you out to find the right path. Just keep thinking aloud.<li>Interviews have a slight luck factor and kind of day dependency. Just be confident and solve all the problems with a positive attitude.<li>Practice questions from GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode and read recent interview experiences.<li>Don\xe2\x80\x99t get demotivated by rejections. Just do your best and improve every day, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t regret anything from the preparation side.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>Some interviews just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a happy ending.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
