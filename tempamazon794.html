Any situation where you can see there are some improvements required and proposed<p>6. There is a large file( 1TB) containing braces. Question is to check for their balance. I said will use a counter, will increment on an open brace and decrement on an close brace. If counter goes negative or counter is non zero at the end of the file, braces are not balanced. Otherwise balanced. Followup question was to make this process parallel (meaning to see if this problem can be solved through parallelism, like dividing the problem into sub problem\xe2\x80\xa6.) Remember the file is very large.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
