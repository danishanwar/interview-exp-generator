I have 1.5 year experience in java. Geeksforgeeks helped me lot. I am very thankful to Geeksforgeeks team. Following were interview questions-<p>Two telephonic rounds followed by 5 F2F interviews.<p><strong>Round 1 (Telephonic):</strong><p>1. There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method, which takes input String without space, to prints all subsets of the input string which is present in dictionary.<p>Example: Dictionary \xe2\x80\x93 a*<br/>\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.Input- aaabaa<br/>\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.Output- a,a,a,aa,aa,aaa,a,a,aa<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2. There is a dictionary already implemented. Write a method , which takes input String without space, to replace the characters from the strings which are not present in dictionary with \xe2\x80\x93<p>Example: Dictionary \xe2\x80\x93 a*<br/>\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.Input- aaabaa<br/>\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.Output- aaa_aa<p>Interviewer was cool. Did not code properly (lots of bugs were in code), but gave good approach for first question. For second question solution sent in a mail.<p><strong>Round 2 (Telephonic):</strong><p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-duplicates-in-small-prime-array/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Write a program to remove duplicates from array of prime numbers.</a><p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-closest-element-in-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Write a program to return nearest elements from a binary search tree for input element.</a><p>This round was very good. Interviewer was very happy with my approach for both questions. Code did not have big bug.<p><strong>Round 1 (F2F- Problem Solving and coding):</strong><br/>1. Tell me about yourself.<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-largest-elements/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Write a program to find top 10 elements on an array of integers.</a><br/>Don\xe2\x80\x99t remember much. Questions were easy. This round was very good. Interviewer was happy with solution.<br/>3. Write a program to calculate a^b and store it in floating point representation.<p><strong>Round 2 (F2F- Computer Fundamental):</strong><br/>1. Tell me about experience in past job.<br/>2. OOPS concepts- Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction.<br/>3. Aggregation and Composition.<br/>4. Design patterns which you have implemented.<br/>5. Write code to implement Singleton design pattern.<br/>6. Design a system to implement options in Pack of cards.<br/>7. Difference between Windows and Unix.<br/>8. Threads, Synchronization, Deadlock.<br/>9. Other subjects which you studied in your academics.<br/>10. Most challenging work you ever faced.<br/>11. Discussed about current project, role.<br/>This round was fair enough. I was not able to discuss questions on subjects which I studied in academics.<p><strong>Round 3 (F2F- Data Structures and Algorithms):</strong><br/>1. Tell me about yourself.<br/>2. There is a 2d array. Write code to find the path with maximum sum. You can only traverse i+1 or j+1.if i is row number and j is column number.<br/>I solved it using dynamic programming<br/>3. In a binary tree find the least common ancestor for two nodes. (Write code)<br/>4. Similar to 3rd question. Write a program to find least common ancestor in binary search tree.<br/>This round was very good. Finished it only 40 mins.<p><strong>Round 4 (F2F- Managerial round):</strong><br/>1. Tell me about yourself.<br/>2. Copy Linked list with orbit pointer.<br/>3. Write a code to find top hundred elements in a data set which cannot be loaded in RAM.<br/>4. Typical parenthesis checking problem.<br/>5. Most challenging work you ever faced.<br/>6. What will do if you get task which is ambiguous.<br/>7. At what extend you will be frustrated if you always get ambiguous problems.<br/>8. How many members in your team in current organization. What\xe2\x80\x99s your role? Questions on current project.<p>Interviewer was very cool and friendly.<p><strong>Round 5 (F2F- Bar raiser round):</strong><br/>1. Tell me about yourself.<br/>2. Discussed about current project.<br/>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/inversion-of-array/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Write a program to find number of inversions in an array.</a><br/>Example- Array 2, 5, 3, 1,10<br/>Inversions (2,1) , (5,1), (3,1), (5,3)<br/>Answer will be \xe2\x80\x93 4<br/>Gave solution of complexity o(nlogn) . Interviewer gave me hint for that.<br/>Hint- Divide and conquer approach.<br/>He asked me to write code which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any bug.<p>This article is compiled by <strong>Neha Gupta</strong>.
