They asked about me and my experiences in previous company. I have created couple of open source projects. Mentioning about them really impress the interviewer if it is really a good one. Then he continued with some data structure questions. I had two questions.<p>Question 1:<p>Given a tree asked to print the path of the tree which has the highest number of bends. Then he modified the question and asked me to code for both.<p>Question 2:<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Given a tree with each node having numbers. Path from root to a leaf node forms a number like (root(1)-&gt;left(2)-&gt;leftLeaf(3) = 123). He asked me to code to add all the number for root to leaf.<p>This round went pretty well.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>It was F2F round(Problem solving). There were two\xc2\xa0interviewers. They directly went for the process after introducing them. This round had 5 questions and was bit hard.<p>Question 1:<p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/match-specific-pattern/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given 2D array for characters and a string, asked to find whether the string follows the pattern of the dictionary</a>. I will explain the pattern below.<p>2D array<p>|a|b|c|<p>|b|c|a|<p>|b|b|a|<p>String: bababbcac<p>\xc2\xa0<p>The pattern is, the words in the dictionary should be present in the string in same order and the letter taken by one word should not be the part of other dictionary word. We should find whether all the dictionary words can be formed or not in the given string.<p>Answer:<p>Let me index the string bababbcac \xe2\x80\x93 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)<p>1st word in dictionary \xe2\x80\x93 abc follows 457<p>2nd\xc2\xa0word in dictionary \xe2\x80\x93 bca follows 268<p>2nd\xc2\xa0word in dictionary \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0bba follows 134<p>Question 2:<p>It was from dynamic programming in string stuff<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using contribute.geeksforgeeks.org or mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
