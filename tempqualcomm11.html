Code snippets were given, need to tell output. The third section was on the operating system, OOPs, and some basic computer architecture and data structure questions.<p><strong>Note: </strong>Test was of 1-hr duration(20 min each section), conducted on hire pro platform<p><strong>Round 2 (First Technical)<p>:</p></strong><ol><li><p>Write a program to insert a node with a given value at the nth position in a singly linked list.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><li><p>Definition of calloc function in C.<li><p>What will be the output of the below program.<pre>int main()\r\n            {\r\n             char a=120,b=140;\r\n             int i;\r\n             i=a+b;\r\n             printf("%d",i);\r\n             }\r\n</pre><p><strong>Note: </strong>ans=4, also need to explain how the answer will be 4.<li><p>What will be the size of the following structure.<pre>struct node{\r\n            int a;\r\n            float b;\r\n            double c;\r\n           }\r\n</pre><li><p>Similar to the above question but with the union instead of structure.<li><p>Memory layout of C program.</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></p></li></p></li></p></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3 (Second Technical):</strong><ol><li>Difference between macro and inline function.<li>Call the main function from the cmd line and pass two arguments to it and with these arguments call macro and inline function defined above. Whose execution will be faster?<li>Find the size of int in C without using sizeof() operator.<li>Inter-Process Communication<li>OOPs concepts<li>Virtual function and virtual class<li>Function overriding and function overloading difference<li>How to implement function overriding in C<li>Extern keyword related questions<li>Some other questions related to operating systems like threads, semaphores, mutex, spinlocks, scheduling algos, etc.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4 (Third technical+ managerial Round):</strong><ul><li>Write a program to delete a node with a given value from a single linked list<li>And some basic Data structures questions. Then he explained about team and work at Qualcomm. Why you want to join like questions.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 5 (Fourth Technical Round):</strong><ol><li>Asked about my project that I mentioned in my Resume.<li>Write a program in C to check if the given string is a palindrome?<li>Write a program to check if the given linked list is circular or not?<li>Write a program to multiply two matrices.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>Note: Data structures questions were basic. Their main focus was on C and the operating systems. After the interviews, I waited for 1 month, and then they gave me an offer letter. I applied through a referral.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
