Of the 20MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of questions were on Quantitative aptitude, relationships, OS, DBMS, Data structures etc. there was negative marking for every wrong answer so I attempted only 15 for which I was sure.<p>Q1- <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/non-repeating-character/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">find the first non repeating character in a string.</a><p>Q2- <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-path-sum/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">given a binary tree where each node has some weight. You have to return the max weight in the binary tree.</a><br/>Maxweight = value of root node + value in its left subtree and right subtree.<pre>\r\nEx  - 2\r\n   /   \\  \r\n  -1    3\r\nOutput = 4 </pre><p><strong>1st round(50 mins):</strong><br/>Q1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-linked-list-in-groups-of-given-size/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reverse link list in k chunks</a><br/>Interviewer was first interested in approach then he asked me to code.<p>Q2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/level-order-traversal-in-spiral-form/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spiral order traversal of binary tree</a><br/>I first told him 2 stack approach but he asked me to do without stack .Then I gave him a solution using one queue and one stack and he finally asked me to code both the approaches.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Q3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-palindrome-in-a-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Longest palindromic substring</a><br/>I first used DP but he asked me to do O(1) space complexity. I was unable to do so.<p><strong>2nd round :</strong><br/>Q1. Connect sibling pointer in a binary tree<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/connect-nodes-at-same-level/1" target="_blank">Connect Nodes at Same Level</a><br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level-with-o1-extra-space/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level-with-o1-extra-space/</a><p>Q2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/special-stack/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Push ,pop and min operations in O(1)</a><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/special-stack/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">He asked me to do middle operation also and then he asked me to code 2nd problem.</a><br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-and-implement-special-stack-data-structure/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-stack-with-find-middle-operation/</a><p>Q3. Given n point in a 2d plane ,find k distant nodes from the origin.<br/>I told him min heap approach and he was satisfied.<p>Q4. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/topological-sort/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Problem statement was very long but it was topological sorting.</a><p>I used adjacency list representation, he asked me why<br/>And finally asked me to code it.<p>Overall it was a very nice experience interviewing with them.<p><strong>Some tips:</strong><ul><li>Never give up<li>Don\xe2\x80\x99t start with coding ,first explain the approach.<li>Be honest<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/</a> \xe2\x80\x93 my guidebook.</li></li></li></li></ul><p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
