The interviewer shared a collabedit link.<p>1&gt; <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-sum-partition/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Divide an array into 2 subarrays such that the absolute difference of their sum is minimum. It was then extended to divide into two subsequences .</a><br/>2&gt; <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/array-to-bst/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Convert a sorted array to a balanced binary search tree.</a><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>3&gt; Convert a linked list with positive and negative integers into a list with first all negative integers, then positive. order amongst negative and positive numbers to be maintained.<p>Generally if first phonescreen is convincing the next step is direct face to face interview , else one has to go through another phonescreen. I had one phonescreen only . After a month i was called for inhouse interviews . All arrangements were made by them .<p><strong>Round 3 :- (Face to Face 1)</strong><br/>1&gt; Define a BST. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-for-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Now check if a binary tree is a BST</a><br/>2&gt; <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of size n, and an integer k. find minimum number in every subarray of size k</a><br/>3&gt; <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/trapping-rain-water/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining</a><br/>4&gt; <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/triplet-sum-in-array/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array find all triplets whose sum is equal to a given number k</a><p><strong>Round 4 :- (Face to Face 2)</strong><br/>1&gt; <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find the diameter of a tree</a>.<br/>2&gt; Print the diameter of a binary tree . (U have only left and right pointers)<br/>3&gt; Assembly scheduling problem (Dynamic Programming paradigm)<p><strong>Round 5 :- (Face to Face 3)</strong><br/>1&gt; How to check if two sets are disjoint ?<br/>2&gt; How to implement hashing for a set .<br/>3&gt; Given n sets , give the minimal number of sets which must be removed so that the remaining sets are all disjoint (Variation of set packing problem)<br/>The interviewer was interested in some greedy heuristic as he knew its an np complete problem and no solution can be better than exponential<br/>4&gt; <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/row-with-max-1s/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You are given a matrix of 1\xe2\x80\x99s and 0\xe2\x80\x99s . The property is thatevery row of matrix is sorted in descending order . Return row with maximum number of 0\xe2\x80\x99s</a><p><strong>Round 6 :- (With senior manager)</strong><br/>Interview started with detailed discussion of projects.<br/>1&gt; Implement lastindexofastring(String s1,String s2) . If s2 is present multiple times return the last index of s2 in s1 , else return -1.<br/>2&gt; Given a paragraph of text, write a program to find the first shortest sub-segment that contains each of the given k words at least once. A segment is said to be shorter than other if it contains less number of words.<p>The interviewer then asked me if i had done something on multithreading . As i was not very confident so i said no and he dint go further .<br/>He then asked me what is my biggest regret in my student life in college .<p>Amazon hr\xe2\x80\x99s were extremely helpful.
