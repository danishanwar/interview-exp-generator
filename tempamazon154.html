The process consisted of 4 rounds overall. (1 test and 3 interviews)<p><strong>Online Round: </strong>The first round is an online test which consisted of aptitude, 2 coding questions(in 1hr), workstyle assessment, and some other sections.<p>The overall difficulty of this round is easy. Amazon repeats coding questions. So make sure you are familiar with the questions they usually ask. I got the Favorite genre(google it) problem and subtree check problem(given roots of 2 trees, check if one is a subtree of the other).<p>You need to pass all the test cases to even be considered by amazon.<p>Out of ~400 students, 51 got shortlisted after this round. Many students who did both the coding questions were not shortlisted. So, do aptitude well just to be on the safe side. Amazon took our interviews on December 1 on Amazon Chime and the code also needs to be written on some amazon platform. The code is written won\xe2\x80\x99t be compiled. The interviewer manually checks the code.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>There were 3 rounds of online interviews. All rounds started with a \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d.
