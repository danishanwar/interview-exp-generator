He then asked is there any exception to reconstruct tree using only one type of traversal. The answer was BST which was my coding question as- Construct the binary search tree using given preorder traversal.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-a-special-tree-from-given-preorder-traversal/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-a-special-tree-from-given-preorder-traversal/</a><p><em>Note</em>: You have to ask about input method and other important details from the interviewer yourself.<p>The first approach I told was O(nlogn) which he asked to optimize then after few minutes of <em>thinking out loud\xc2\xa0</em> and with a small hint I got the O(n) solution and after coding it, tried to dry run it and the question was done.<p>Then he moved to some basic paradigms of OOPCs , following with the difference between run time polymorphism and compile time polymorphism.<p>Here is the link <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-c/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-c/</a> to the answer.<p>He asked the next question which was\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-closest-elements-given-value/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-closest-elements-given-value/</a> with first O(n) then the optimised one with O(logn+k).<p>And with this round-1 ended.<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
