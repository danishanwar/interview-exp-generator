I got following questions:\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<ol><li>Given a string find the number of occurrences of regex\xe2\x80\x99 10*1\xe2\x80\xb2.<li>given a condition that only odd-numbered\xc2\xa0cars can be used on odd-numbered days and even-numbered cars can be used on even-numbered days. you are given an array of car numbers and a date, find out the number of cars that can be used.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-positive-points-to-reach-destination/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-positive-points-to-reach-destination/</a></li></li></li></ol><p>I was able to solve two questions and I was selected for next round. 70 students were selected for next round.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 2:(Group fly)\xc2\xa0</strong> (30 MINUTES)This round was pen and paper round.All students were given a question and we need to write algorithm as well as code on paper. write neat code and properly explain your algorithm. question is given below:\xc2\xa0<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perfect-sum-problem-print-subsets-given-sum/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perfect-sum-problem-print-subsets-given-sum/</a>\xc2\xa0<p>25 students were selected for next round.\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 3:(technical interview)\xc2\xa0</strong>Interviewer first asked me to explain my projects. One of my projects was on jdbc so he asked me a query on sql related to it. Explain your projects properly and confidently. Then he asked me below question:\xc2\xa0<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-pattern-without-using-any-loop/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-pattern-without-using-any-loop/</a>\xc2\xa0<p>I answered this question and wrote the code.\xc2\xa0Then he asked me to develop test cases for this questions. I found out the cases where a solution to this question may fail. Then he asked me questions on OOPS concepts (inheritance, difference between class and\xc2\xa0 objects, etc)\xc2\xa0<p>I was shortlisted for the next round.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 4:(technical interview)\xc2\xa0</strong>Interviewer asked me for brief description of my projects. Then he asked me to tell the approach which i used in group fly round. I had used Dynamic programming. Then he asked me to find more optimized way as dp was using a lot of space for a large amount of numbers. So I tried recursion and he said it will use lot of time. so I tried sorting and some more approaches like trees etc.\xc2\xa0<p>Then he asked me a question that there are aeroplanes landing and taking off. we need to construct a system which will ensure collision-free landings and taking offs. I told an approach using semaphores. He discussed this approach in depth and then said that in aviation\xc2\xa0what will be the factors considered for collision then I said that we will check speed, angles, etc. He was checking how much pressure I can handle and in such pressure how much I can think. Then he asked me about normalisation, denormalisation, OOPS concepts like real-life significance of objects, what is the real life example of linked list.\xc2\xa0<p>I was shortlisted for the next round.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 5(HR+technical)\xc2\xa0</strong>Interviewer asked me the following questions:\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<ol><li>tell me about yourself \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0 projects<li>strength<li>weakness<li>how your weakness effects you<li>what do you know about microsoft\xc2\xa0(its products)<li>machine learning<li>cloud computing<li>benefits of cloud<li>where do you see yourself after 5 years?</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>8 students were selected for Microsoft and I was one of them. Geeksforgeeks helped me a lot to achieve this.<br/>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
