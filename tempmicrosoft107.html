They are very helping. Even if don\xe2\x80\x99t have any clue of the question, put some efforts to solve it.<p>What i have experienced is, giving correct answer is not important, but the way you answer the question is more important.<p><strong>Round 4 (technical interview II):</strong><p>The first question he asked me is to sort a stack using a temporary stack.<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QE7AFwdtiF"><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-stack-using-temporary-stack/">Sort a stack using a temporary stack</a></p></blockquote><p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QE7AFwdtiF" frameborder="0" height="338" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" sandbox="allow-scripts" scrolling="no" security="restricted" src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-stack-using-temporary-stack/embed/#?secret=QE7AFwdtiF" style="position:absolute;clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px)" title="\xe2\x80\x9cSort a stack using a temporary stack\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 GeeksforGeeks" width="600"></iframe><p>The want a code with least time complexity and minimum number of lines(10-15 lines of function).<p>He further asked me about static and dynamic memory allocation and the difference between the fully object oriented language and object oriented language.<p><strong><em>Out of 14 students, 7 students were shortlisted for the HR round.</em></strong><p><strong>Round 5 (HR round) :</strong><p>The interview was conducted on Skype.<p>Interviewer asked questions related to strength and weakness.
