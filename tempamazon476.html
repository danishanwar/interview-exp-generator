There were 3 rounds in all \xe2\x80\x93 1 Online Round followed by 2 F2F Interviews<p><strong>Round 1: Online Round (90 minutes)</strong><br/>There were 2 coding questions and 20 MCQs mostly on Time Complexities (Master Theorem), Logical Reasoning, Data Structures and Algorithms, around 2 from OS, DBMS and Networking each.<p>The 2 coding questions were:<ol><li>Find the sum of lengths of non-overlapping contiguous subarrays with k as the maximum element.<pre>\r\n   Ex: Array: {2,1,4,9,2,3,8,3,4} and k = 4\r\n   <strong> Ans: 5 \r\n            {2,1,4} =&gt; Length = 3\r\n            {3,4}   =&gt; Length = 2\r\n            So, 3 + 2 = 5 is the answer </strong>\r\n</pre><p><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-lengths-of-non-overlapping-subarrays/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>You are given an array A where A[i] <em>(1-based indexing)</em> denotes the number of chocolates corresponding to each station. When we move from station <strong>i</strong> to station <strong>i+1</strong> we get <strong><em>A[i] \xe2\x80\x93 A[i+1]</em></strong> chocolates for free. Note that if this number is negative, we lose that many chocolates. We can only move from station i to station i+1 and that too if and only if we have non-negative number of chocolates with us. Given that cost of one chocolate is <strong>Rs. P </strong>, our task is to find the minimum cost incurred in reaching station <strong>n</strong> from the first station (station <strong>1</strong>).<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/chocolate-station/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><pre>\r\nEx: A: {1,2,3} and P = 10\r\n<strong> Ans: 30</strong>\r\nTo reach station 1 from the starting station, we need to buy 1 chocolate\r\nTo reach station 2 form station 1, we get A[1] - A[2] = -1 chocolates i.e. we lose 1 chocolate. Hence, we need to buy 1 chocolate.\r\nSimilarly, we need to buy 1 chocolate to reach station 3 from station 2.\r\n<strong>Hence, total cost incurred = (1+1+1)*10 = 30</strong>\r\n</pre><p>Out of around 150 students, 26 were shortlisted for Round 2.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2: FTF Interview (Around 30-40 minutes)</strong><br/>First, the interviewer told me to introduce myself and then asked 3 coding questions:<ol><li>Search for an element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted 2D Matrix<br/>I started with a O(R*C) solution, followed it up with an O(RlogC) solution and finally gave the O(R+C) solution.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Given an array of n elements and a number, find a pair in the array with sum equal to that number.<br/>This question was followed up with finding a triplet with sum equal to Zero.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/key-pair/0" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>I was provided with a function <strong><em>int getval(int x)</em></strong> which basically takes the value of <em>x</em> and returns <em>f(x)</em>. Given that f(x) is a monotonically increasing function, my task was to find the smallest value of x such that f(x) &gt; 0.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3: FTF Interview (Around 30 minutes)</strong><br/>The interviewer once again asked me to introduce myself and asked 3 questions:<ol><li>What is Data Abstraction. Explain it with a real-life example.<li>What are infix and postfix expressions. He then asked me to write a pseudo-code for converting infix expression to postfix expression.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/infix-to-postfix/0" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Multiply 2 numbers without using Multiplication or Division operator, Bitwise operators or any loop.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiply-two-numbers-without-using-multiply-division-bitwise-operators-and-no-loops/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><p>I gave him a recursive approach and he was pretty happy with it<p>Finally, he asked me if I had any questions for him.</p></p></li></li></li></ol><p>Out of the 26 selected for the interviews, 13 were finally selected for internship.<p>During my preparation <strong>GEEKSFORGEEKS</strong>, indeed, was a great help. Preparing from articles under DS and Algo section would give anybody a definite chance to clear all rounds. A big thank you to other geeks as well for sharing their interview experiences as going through past experiences was the perfect way to end my preparations.<p>This article is contributed by <strong>Harsh Modi</strong>.
