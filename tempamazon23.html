I managed to solve nearly 50% of the questions. So, after nearly 6 months, I got a mail that my profile has been shortlisted from Codechef.<p>After attending the preparation session for 3-4 times, finally they scheduled my interviews. There were 3 rounds scheduled on the same day.<p><strong>Round 1(70 mins-Taken by SDE): </strong>The interview started off with my introduction and I was asked some questions about my role at previous job. After that I was asked 2-3 questions on leadership principles. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93&gt;20mins\xc2\xa0<p>After this, the interviewer asked 2 coding questions.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decode-string-recursively-encoded-count-followed-substring/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decode-string-recursively-encoded-count-followed-substring/</a>.<span class="text-big"> </span>I discussed the stack approach with the interviewer and after that I coded the solution.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-binary-tree-is-subtree-of-another-binary-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-binary-tree-is-subtree-of-another-binary-tree/</a></li></li></ol><p>After suggesting brute force approach for this, I had to take several hints from the interviewer for the optimal solution(by comparing inorder traversals of both trees). But, finally I got it right and the interviewer was satisfied.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2(60 mins \xe2\x80\x93 Taken by Technical Program Manager-II): </strong>Again, the interview started off with my introduction and I was asked some questions about my role at previous job. After that I was asked another 2-3 questions on leadership principles. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93&gt;20mins<p>After this, the interviewer asked 2 coding questions.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fix-two-swapped-nodes-of-bst/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fix-two-swapped-nodes-of-bst/</a>. I discussed the approach with the interviewer first. It took some time for me to explain this: When there is more than one pair in inorder traversal which does not follow the property, in[i]&lt;in[j], which one to swap and why?<li>This one was a very specific question. But, after thinking for a while, I realized it was a basic heap question.</li></li></ol><p>I was able to code both questions within time(40 mins), although I realized I gave the wrong TC for one of the questions.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 3(60 mins \xe2\x80\x93 Taken by Manager, Software Development): </strong>It started with my introduction. After that, it moved to my CV and I was asked to choose a project mentioned in my resume. I was asking various questions about it, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go through my project before interview, so I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to answer even some of the most basic questions, I was really embarrassed. After that, they said some leadership principles. All of this took 30 mins.<p>After this, I was asked one coding question<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/</a>. Along with with the sum, I also had to print the elements included in the sum. I tried to do this in single traversal only using Kadane\xe2\x80\x99s. But, the time ran out and I failed to explain the approach properly. I felt terrible after this round and I felt like I botched it.\xc2\xa0</li></ol><p>But, I think because my first 2 rounds were good, I got call for the last round.<p><strong>Round 4(45 mins \xe2\x80\x93 Taken by Manager, Software Development): </strong>It started with my introduction and I was asked some basic questions about my role at current company. After that, I was asked one coding question:<ol><li>Given a string containing of digits, print in the below manner:<pre>11 -&gt; one 1\r\n21 -&gt; two 1\'s\r\n3233 -&gt; three 2\'s, and three 3\'s</pre><p>I discussed the approach and coded the solution.</p></li></ol><p>After this, I was asked 2-3 more questions on leadership principles. Overall, I think this round was pretty chill.<p><strong>Verdict: Selected</strong><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
