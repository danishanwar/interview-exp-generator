Both coding questions were on the easier side. After 1 week of this round, I got a mail from their recruitment team and I have cleared this round.<p><strong>Round 1(Nov 2021):</strong> The interviewer started with a quick introduction and then asked me to explain one of my projects and asked some questions on that project. Then we moved to the coding question.\xc2\xa0<ul><li>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/</a></li></li></ul><p>\xc2\xa0He first asked me to explain the approach and then write the code. I did both questions then he asked me the space and time complexities. In the end, he asked if I have any questions for him.<p><strong>Round 2(Nov 2021):</strong> In this round too the interviewer started with introductions then she asked me some behavioral questions like \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you do when you disagree with someone?\xe2\x80\x9d. Then she asked me about hash functions and some oops concepts. Finally, she asked me if I want to ask something.<p><strong>Round 3(Jan 2022): </strong>This round was taken by SDM. He directly jumped to coding questions. He only asked me one question.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/step-by-step-directions-from-a-binary-tree-node-to-another/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/step-by-step-directions-from-a-binary-tree-node-to-another/</a><p>he asked me to explain the approach and then space and time complexity. I did the question but was told the wrong time complexity.<p><strong>Round 4(March 2022):</strong> This round was also taken by SDM. \xc2\xa0He quickly jumped on my work experience and asked what are difficulties you have faced in your present job, then he asked why I want to join Amazon. Then he moved on to the coding questions.<p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/</a><p>He first told me to explain the approach, when I explained my approach then he told me to code. I could not do the question but my approach was somewhat similar to what was even in the GFG solution. Then like other interviewers, he asked me if I have any questions for him.<p>Verdict: After 3 days they called me to say <strong>you are selected</strong>.<p><strong>Tips:</strong><ul><li>Practice coding questions from GFG and Leetcode.<li>Have knowledge of projects and work experience you have mentioned in your resume.<li>Practice behavioral questions, don\xe2\x80\x99t take them lightly.<li>Believe in yourself.</li></li></li></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
