(<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-possible-decodings-given-digit-sequence/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-possible-decodings-given-digit-sequence/</a>)<li>Given Equation for num1, num2, and X in the form of a string, and you have to find the value of X in the string.<pre>Ex: String is 100000+200000=X\r\nX will be 300000\r\nString is 100000+X=500000\r\nX will be 400000</pre></li></li></ol><p>I Solved both the coding Questions.<p>\xc2\xa0Be prepared with all pointer concepts and how to return the char string, etc.<p><strong>Round 2(Algorithm Round): </strong>I was told to introduce myself. Then he directly went on to the question. The question was :\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Given a square chessboard of N x N size, the position of Knight and the destination is given. you need to find out the minimum steps a Knight will take to reach the Destination and print the path for the same. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-steps-reach-target-knight/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-steps-reach-target-knight/</a>)</li></ol><p>Initially, they give me a basic BFS solution that looks at all 8 K Knight modes that will take O (N * N) Time.<p>I was told that I had done well in the code as a wise decision maker. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the interviewer was expecting. I was thinking of the A * Search Algorithm that discarded a particular combination but lost the solution (meaning it comes close to the solution in a very short time, used by Google Maps).<p>I did not expect to qualify for this cycle. But luckily I was called to the next round.<p><strong>Round 3(Algorithm Round): </strong>The interviewer was very chill. In the beginning, I introduced myself to her, and then she introduced herself. I was supposed to give a brief description of any one of my Project(10 min).<ol><li>Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k node. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/</a>)<li>Given a Binary Tree, find the deepest leaf node that is left child of its parent. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deepest-left-leaf-node-in-a-binary-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deepest-left-leaf-node-in-a-binary-tree/</a>)</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4(Fundamental + Algorithm): </strong>Initially, I introduced myself. The interviewer was very calm. He asked me about my Subjects. Then the fundamental knowledge was checked in depth. Ex-<ul><li>Paging / Virtual Memory<li>CPU Scheduling Algorithm<li>Deadlock / Semaphore / Critical Section<li>Working of OSI Layers(CN)<li>What happens if I type \xe2\x80\x98google.com\xe2\x80\x99 as URL. Explain the whole process.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 5(Tech Round): </strong>The interviewer was a highly experienced person. Firstly I introduced myself. I was told to explain any one of my projects, and he told me that how will you improve the same project now.<p>Then he asked one tree question \xe2\x80\x94 I was feeling headache, and I was just smiling, the interviewer thought that I was familiar with this question and asked me that whether I am familiar with the question or not, and I said yes(even the question was not familiar to me but don\xe2\x80\x99t this I was lucky at that time)<p>Then he swapped the question. And asked this \xe2\x80\x93<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-the-two-binary-search-trees-are-identical-or-not/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-the-two-binary-search-trees-are-identical-or-not/</a></li></ol><p>I was supposed to just tell the Algorithm orally. Then he asked me about my interests.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
