In this round, they asked two questions<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li>Find the square root of number up to 3 precision<li>Design queue using stack</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3: F2F Problem Solving</strong><p>In this round also Interviewer asked two coding questions. For the second question, he gave some used cases and explained thoroughly and asked to write production-ready code and some technical questions from Java since I mentioned Java in my resume<ul><li>Clone a Linked List with next and random pointer<li>Minimum Heap tree<li>What is Polymorphism,<li>Explain real-life case of Function overloading and overriding<li>What are virtual destructor and a private constructor</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 4:\xc2\xa0 Video call on Amazon Chime App</strong><p>The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and brief him about my job role and contributions. Some questions he asked regarding my company project on which I am working. Later he starts some generic questions like:<ul><li>Why do you want to change job?<li>Why only Amazon?<li>Anything that you had taken lead or gave your ideas to your Lead or Manager</li></li></li></ul><p>He shared a live screen to write code. He asked me to explain the approach first and time and space complexity<p>Coding question:<ul><li>Find the rank of every element in a stream.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rank-element-stream/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rank-element-stream/</a></li></ul><p>I explained him using Insertion sorting but due to its worst time complexity, he asked to think some other way. He helped me in writing code using binary search tree and coding round went well.<p><strong>Round 5: Bar Raiser</strong><p>In this round Interviewer checked how technically strong and capable enough to handle any sorts of challenging tasks based on our past works. He asked some generic questions like:<ul><li>Why do you want to change job?<li>He asked some questions\xc2\xa0 seeing my resume<li>\xc2\xa0Any critical issues have you resolved? If yes, then how were your approach, resolve, and impacts<li>He asked many questions related to Automation Framework that I created using java and Selenium</li></li></li></li></ul><p>He asked to solve one code on the live share screen. Firstly, he asked to tell him the approach and what will be time and space complexity and what kind of Data Structure will you prefer.<p>Coding question:<ul><li class="entry-title">Boggle (Find all possible words in a board of characters)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-find-possible-words-board-characters/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-find-possible-words-board-characters/</a></li></ul><p>I explained to him and write code using BFS. Although, it was not the best solution but he convinced.<p><strong>Result:\xc2\xa0</strong>Hard luck not selected. This was my first interview experience with Amazon. Although, not selected in the first attempt but gain enough confidence for a future interview.<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Mention only those kinds of stuff in your resume which you can explain well. Be prepared with Data Structure and Algorithm and technical questions from the domain where you worked on.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
