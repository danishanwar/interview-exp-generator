A tournament is going on and each match is playing in one city. All city\xe2\x80\x99s people gather to watch match. Traffic department wants to manage how many people travel through city x if match is playing in city y for each x. City x and y can be any city.<br/>Code &amp; edge case<br/>Soln :- DFS with optimization O(n)<li>Torch problem : There is a bridge and N no. people takes (a1,a2,\xe2\x80\x94an) time to cross it and there are K torch and at any time x no of people can pass the bridge and it takes maximum of x people to cross it. Minimum time required to cross it.<br/>Devise algo and write down code<br/>Solution :- Sort array take x min pass it from one end to another. Bring min among them to one side send x maximum to other side and again bring 2nd min from other side again send x max follow it in cyclic way If all x min reached to one end again send x min to another side. DS used Dequeue.</li></li></ol><p><strong>2nd Round :- (1hr)</strong><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-an-iterative-olog-y-function-for-powx-y/">Program to calculate x^y in log(y) .</a><br/>There focus is on all edge case he want me to write down all test case and validate my code.<li>Design bus booking system:- Each row has x seat. If customer wants K seats if you have K consecutive seats available, reserve them. Otherwise give seats from any row.<br/>Focus on DS &amp; code<br/>Solution :- Create adjacency list like 1 seat available in which row. 2 seats available in which row and so on and do the operation for each reserve call</li></li></ol><p><strong>3rd Round :- (1.5hr )</strong><ol><li>Change characters of strings to another set of characters in place. You can increase length of string one time.<br/>ab-&gt;bc<br/>cd-&gt;ki<br/>Focus on Code &amp; Edge case<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-element-in-an-array-which-is-first-increasing-and-then-decreasing/">An array is increasing upto a number and then decreasing find the the pivot number.</a><br/>All edge case &amp; program. Your program should handle all edge case.<br/>I propose if it contain duplicate Or if whole array is large it can\xe2\x80\x99t fit into memory and their solution.<br/>They wanted to see about edge case being handled.<li>E-commerce architecture related to my past experience. I had taken marker and explained it on white board. It will give you more advantage .</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>4th Round :-(1hr)</strong><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wildcard-character-matching/">String matching problem one string contains wildcard characters</a>. Code &amp; edge case &amp; recursive diagram. All test case and validate it .<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-length-bitonic-subarray/">Maximum length of Sub-array contain increasing then decreasing</a> . Code &amp; Edge case</li></li></ol><p><strong>5th Round :- Engineering Manager (45 min)</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Design a crawler to fetch code from n system and merge it<br/>Speak aloud what are you thinking about..<li>Class design, Operation, Entity<br/>Solution : Like Github with version &amp; Conflict &amp; Backup &amp; Job<br/>Engineering Manager really impressed with my Scalable design approach</li></li></ol><p><strong>6th Round :- Hiring Manager (1hr)</strong><ol><li>There are n no of pages and when a user visits page x it is writing in a log file. Recommend each user a page from his past experience .<br/>Solution : Treat page as a node and weight is how many times he visited from page x to page y. Maintain map of user and adjacency list and do the operation.<br/>Code &amp; edge case &amp; Most important they try to create some hostile environment to judge you how much you are fit for any environment &amp; But if you tackle it they are very friendly.<p>Tips : Ask questions if you have any confusion .</p></li></ol><p>Thanks to GeeksForGeeks.
