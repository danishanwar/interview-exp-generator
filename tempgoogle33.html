I was given tons of resources by the recruiter to prepare for the interviews. I will try to share all possible resources, questions (hint), most important topics to study, platforms for practicing (daily questions and mock interviews), some tips, good blogs, and of course the mistakes that you should never make while preparing for big techs. Undoubtedly the technical interviews at Google are heavily based on DSA and it has got its own level of difficulty but I gave my best and went up to 3rd round after the written coding round. This drive and experience are really full of learning.\xc2\xa0<p><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201225134104/googleinvite.jpg"/><p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s start the preparation<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Bookmark the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/google/">GFG Google Archives</a>.

Both were based on concepts of DP. The first question was quite similar to the classical DP question (minimum steps to reach 1) https://www.spoj.com/problems/MST1/. The second question was quite the same as https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/. In this, we are supposed to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string. The first question was fully solved and the second one was partially accepted since I used the brute force approach.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 2(Telephonic Interview): </strong>This round went quite well. In this, I was asked 2 questions. The first one was a medium level pattern searching question (strings)<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/algorithms-gq/pattern-searching/">. GFG link </a>for further details. The second question was based on heaps (priority queues), \xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-integers-running-integers/">GFG link</a>.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 3: </strong>This round was also virtual. It has some difficult questions when compared to the previous rounds. The first question was similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/, the other question was based on a similar concept like https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/, another one was https://leetcode.com/problems/angle-between-hands-of-a-clock/. This round went okayish and I was called for the next round.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 4: </strong>This round was tougher than all previous rounds, 1 DP medium and 1 Graph Hard question was asked. I was able to solve the first one but got stuck in Graphs :(.\xc2\xa0Graph question was similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/ ( little more tricky) and the DP question was also from leetcode medium. This round did not go too well for me.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Tips:</strong><ol><li><p>Prepare a good resume (clean, clear, and precise).
