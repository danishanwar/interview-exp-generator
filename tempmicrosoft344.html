GeeksForGeeks helped me a lot in preparing for the coding tests as well as for interviews. The positions that they were interviewing for were SDE and SDET(Testing).<p><strong>1st Round. \xe2\x80\x93 Online \xe2\x80\x93 30 mins</strong><br/>The first round was an online round which was hosted on cocubes.com. There were 20 MCQ questions. Questions were from a variety of topics like Algorithms, Data structures, C, C++, OOPs, Memory Management, Computer Architecture, etc.<p><strong>2nd Round. \xe2\x80\x93 Online \xe2\x80\x93 1 hour</strong><br/>This was a coding round in which two problems were given.<ol><li><em>Problem \xe2\x80\x93 1:</em> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-occurences-of-anagrams/">Given a word and a text, return the count of the occurrences of anagrams of the word in the text.</a><br/>For eg. word is \xe2\x80\x9cfor\xe2\x80\x9d and the text is \xe2\x80\x9cforxxorfxdofr\xe2\x80\x9d, anagrams of \xe2\x80\x9cfor\xe2\x80\x9d will be \xe2\x80\x9cofr\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9corf\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9dfro\xe2\x80\x9d, etc. So the answer would be 3 for this particular example<li><em>Problem \xe2\x80\x93 2:</em> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-right-sibling-binary-tree-parent-pointers/">Given a binary tree with parent pointers, find the right sibling of a given node</a>(pointer to the node will be given), if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist return null. Do it in O(1) space and O(n) time.</li></li></ol><p><strong>3rd Round \xe2\x80\x93 Group Test \xe2\x80\x93 Code on paper \xe2\x80\x93 45 mins</strong><br/>First, we had to discuss the solution with the assigned mentor and then we had to code it on paper(no pseudo code)<ol><li><em>Problem 1:</em> Given a BST, one of the nodes violates the BST property( left-child &lt; parent &lt; right child ), return the pointer to that node.<li><em>Problem 2:</em> Two no.s having equal no. of digits were given in the form of singly linklist. (For eg.- 102 will be given as 1 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 2 ). Add these no.s and return the answer in the form of a singly linkllist. Do it in O(n) time, given n digit numbers<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>4th Round \xe2\x80\x93 Interview</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>I had to implement a T9 dictionary . insertWord function and populateWords were the two functions which I had to implement on paper(again no pseudo code).<p>First I have to discuss the approach with the interviewer and then he asked me to code.</p></li></ol><p><strong>5th Round \xe2\x80\x93 Interview</strong><ol><li>He dicussed the work that I did in my last summer internship and after that he asked me to code the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/">maximum subarray problem</a> in one pass.</li></ol><p>I and my friends who got internships at Adobe Research, Amazon, De-Shaw, Samsung would like to thanks GeeksForGeeks for maintaining a high-quality problem set for coding tests and interviews.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
