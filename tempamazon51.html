Distance is calculated using the formula (x^2 + y^2). If there is a tie then choose the co-ordinate with the least x value. Sample Input :</li></ul><pre>All Locations : [ [1, 2] , [1, -1], [3, 4] ]\r\nnumOfDeliveries : 2\r\nSample Output :\r\n[ [1, -1], [1 , 2] ]</pre><ul><li>The output list can be in any order. This question was basically K closest points to the origin (0,0) with added tie condition.<li>Demolition Robot: Given a matrix with values 0 (trenches), 1 (flat), and 9 (obstacle) you have to find the minimum distance to reach 9 (obstacle). If not possible then return -1.<li>The demolition robot must start at the top left corner of the matrix, which is always flat and can move on the block up, down, right, left. The demolition robot cannot enter 0 trenches and cannot leave the matrix.</li></li></li></ul><pre>Sample Input :\r\n[1, 0, 0],\r\n[1, 0, 0],\r\n[1, 9, 1]]\r\nSample Output :\r\n3</pre><ul><li>This question can be solved by using BFS or DFS.</li></ul><p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Interviews<p>Generate the sequence of N magic numbers.
