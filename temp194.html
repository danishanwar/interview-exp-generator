This was more concentrated on my previous projects,<ol><li>Give me the situations where you failed and pushed back.<li>Tell me the hardest task done by you till now and how you solved it.<li>If you are assigned two interns and there are two other interns who are assigned to someone else outside the team. But these two are also in your team, and they notice other two interns asking questions to you and so they start asking thing to you, due to this you are lacking in your productive time, how will you react?<li>Tell me the thing that hurt you the most in your career and how did you react to it?<li>Some leadership-related questions were also there.</li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>And some more questions on OS and CN.<p><strong>Round 3: </strong>This was straight coding round.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>The zigzag traversal of a Binary tree: Gave a solution with BFS using Queue and Stack but he wanted me to optimize it, so used two stacks and that worked.
