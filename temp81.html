After few days, I got an exam link from Amazon. In the exam, there were 2 coding questions(DP, Greedy) and 2 descriptive questions in which we have to explain how we approached the above 2 questions and write about their time and space complexities.<p>After few months, I got an Amazon Interview preparation call, in which they explained the whole interview process.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Interview Round 1: </strong>The interviewer was SDE2 and made me comfortable by telling about himself and asking about myself. Then he asked about my projects, it was a long discussion and took 25 mins.<ul><li>Then he asked a coding question:<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-set-2-using-trie/"> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-set-2-using-trie/</a>. I first told him the DFS approach and then optimized using trie. We discussed all the edge cases and time complexity. He seemed impressed by my approach.</li></ul><p>I had the next interview scheduled just after this.<p><strong>Interview Round 2: </strong>The interviewer was SDE2 and she directly started with coding questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>The first question was: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-rotated-array4618/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-rotated-array4618/1</a>. I started with brute force and the explained O(nlogn) \xc2\xa0solution using Binary search. After some, I told her the O(n) approach.<li>The second question was: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix17201720/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix17201720/1</a>. I solved it using binary search.</li></li></ol><p>After few weeks my next rounds got scheduled.<p><strong>Interview Round 3: </strong>The interviewer started with a briefing about himself and then asked about myself.<ul><li>Then he asked, have you ever faced a problem with a deadline?<li>Then asked the question: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimize-cash-flow-among-given-set-friends-borrowed-money/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimize-cash-flow-among-given-set-friends-borrowed-money/</a>. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this question before, so I took 4-5 mins to think. Then I explained to him my approach using DFS and bottle-neck. We discussed all the edge cases and time and space complexities. Although its preferred approach is greedy, I was able to do it in the same time complexity using DFS. \xc2\xa0He was happy with my solution.</li></li></ul><p>Round 4 was scheduled the next day.<p><strong>Interview Round 4:</strong><ol><li>The interview started with the coding question: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/1</a> He said don\xe2\x80\x99t modify the input, so I used recursion with some conditions. He was impressed with the solution.<li>Then he asked another question: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-a-binary-tree-in-vertical-order/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-a-binary-tree-in-vertical-order/1</a>. I explained the approach using preorder traversal, then he said it will give a wrong answer for some cases so I used level order traversal. He also asked me to tell efficient and optimized data structure for this problem.<li>Have you ever learnt something on your own.<li>On what technology do you want to work.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>Then he said we will let you know in 7 days.<p>After 7 days I got a call from HR that you got selected.<p>Keep solving problems, gain basic knowledge of all CS Subjects. Go through Amazon Leadership principles and have faith in yourself.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
