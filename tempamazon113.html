She sent me the coding test link which I had to complete within a week. Once I completed the test, I got a call to schedule the interviews. All interviews were held on Amazon Chime as per schedule.\xc2\xa0<br/>Overall process took 1 month to complete the test and interviews.<br/>Following are the questions that were asked:<p><strong>HackerRank Test (90 Minutes online test)</strong><br/><strong>1. Shopping Options:</strong> We are given the costs of a list of pants, shirts, shoes, skirts. We have a certain amount of cash with us, we need to determine the total number of possible combinations which we can buy given that we must buy one and only one of each type.<pre>Eg: pants=[3, 5, 7], shirts = [4, 7, 8],\r\nskirts = [5, 8], shoes = [3], budget = 25</pre><p>So in the above e.g., apart from the combination [7, 8, 8, 3], all others are possible.<p>Hint: Since we have to buy all, we can combine the first two lists and the last two lists, so we would have cost lists like pants_shirts = [\xe2\x80\xa6] and<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>skirts_shoes = [\xe2\x80\xa6], now we can just iterate over one list and binary search the remaining amount over the other list and add accordingly.<p><strong>2. Storage Optimization: </strong>Amazon is experimenting with a flexible storage system for their warehouses. The storage unit consists of a shelving system that is one meter deep with removable vertical and horizontal separators. When all separators are installed each storage space is one cubic meter(1*1*1). Determine the volume of the largest space when a series of horizontal and vertical separators are removed.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<pre>n = 6\r\nm = 6;\r\nh = [4]\r\nv = [2]</pre><p><strong>Round 1(Problem Solving): 50 Minutes</strong><p>First round was taken by a Software Engineer Manager who was residing in US. He introduced himself and then asked about some question related to Amazon leadership Principle.<br/>Then asked one problem solving question. Given a list of words return a Map of words which can be formed by using other words which exist in the same list. He asked only one problem solving question. Most focus was on leadership Principle.<blockquote><p>input = [\xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crise\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cset\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9csunrise\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9csu\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cnset\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9csunset\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cmind\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9chappymind\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crise\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9chappysunrise\xe2\x80\x9d]<p>output = {<br/>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9chappymind\xe2\x80\x9d : [[\xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cmind]],<br/>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9csunrise\xe2\x80\x9d : [[\xe2\x80\x9csu\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crise\xe2\x80\x9d], [\xe2\x80\x9csun\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crise\xe2\x80\x9d]],<br/>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9csunset\xe2\x80\x9d : [[\xe2\x80\x9csun\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cset\xe2\x80\x9d], [\xe2\x80\x9csu\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cset]], \xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9chappysunrise\xe2\x80\x9d : [[\xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9csunrise\xe2\x80\x9d], [\xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9csun\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crise\xe2\x80\x9d], [\xe2\x80\x9chappy\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9csu\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cn\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9crise\xe2\x80\x9d]]<br/>}</p></p></blockquote><p><strong>Round 2(Problem Solving): 50 Minutes</strong><p>Second round was taken by a SDE3 guy who was also in US. He introduced himself and then asked some questions related to Amazon leadership Principle.<p>He also asked me only one Problem Solving question.<p>Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.<br/>\xc2\xa0<blockquote><p>For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].</p></blockquote><p>I solved it by multiplying the complete array then divide each index item to the complete sum.<p>Then he asked me not to use division. Was able to do in O(n) time complexity<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-product-array-puzzle/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-product-array-puzzle/</a><p><strong>Round 3(System Design): 1 hr 10 minutes</strong><p>Third round was a system design round which is taken by Senior engineer manager.<p>He introduced himself and the team he was hiring for.\xc2\xa0 He asked some question related Amazon leaderShip principles. \xc2\xa0<p>He asked me to design a Distributed Scheduler which should work for all kinds of clients (Human, Machines {APIs}).\xc2\xa0<br/>Main functionality he asked me to implement was to schedule a job and remind the client about the job at set time.<br/>\xc2\xa0<ul><li>Mostly High level design,\xc2\xa0<li>More questions on scalability, availability, fault tolerance, and resilience.<li>Ensure all jobs will work.\xc2\xa0<li>How system will work in peak time.<li>What should be the time frame in which user will notify?<br/>\xc2\xa0</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 4(Bar-Raiser): 1 hr 25 minutes</strong><p>Fourth round was the bar raiser round.
