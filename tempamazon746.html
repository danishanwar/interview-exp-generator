Here is my amazon experience.<p>1000 people attend round 1<br/><strong>Round 1: (1.30 hrs)</strong><br/>20 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s + 2 coding question<br/>19 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s were from os,c++,java and single mcq from probability<br/>Coding questions:<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/stickler-theif/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find maximum sum in a array,such that no two elements are adjacent.</a><br/>For example 3,2,7,10 should return 13, sum of 3 and 10. Handle for negative cases too.<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/vertical-sum/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a binary search tree,print the sum of all nodes that are in same axis</a> (Modification of vertical order traversal)<p>I attended 12 mcq\xe2\x80\x99s. There was negative marking,so i attended the questions which i was very confident and did both programs.<br/>I was confident that i will clear the round 1.<p><strong>Round 2: (Group Fly Activity) ( 1 hr)</strong><br/>Around 36 people were shortlisted for second round.<br/>We were divided into many groups and each group was alloted a mentor.<br/>Two questions were given and we have to discuss the approach with mentor and only after getting his approval we have to code.<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/finding-number/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a monotonically increasing and then decreasing array with duplicates and a key, return true if key exists in array.</a><br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-k-sorted-arrays/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given k sorted arrays of different or equal sizes, merge them into a single sorted array.</a><br/>Thanks to mentor, he was very cool and helpful, I did both the codes and handled corner cases too.<p><strong>Round 3: (30-45 min)</strong><br/>18 people were shortlisted for third round and i was one among them.<br/>First the interviewer asked to tell about myself.<br/>Then he asked why i had low cgpa when compared with my school marks.<br/>Then came the first question<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-cost-of-ropes/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given n ropes of different length, combine them into a single rope,such that total cost is minimum. You can tie two ropes at a time,and cost of tying is sum of length of ropes.</a><br/>First i gave a solution similar to insertion sort in a linked list,he was not satisfied, and then I gave a min heap approach. He asked for time complexity. I got wrong,so he asked what steps u will do and time complexity for each step. He added all the step cost and asked me to arrive at final time complexity.<br/>After this, I got correct.<p>Then he asked about 2nd code in group fly activity.I used merge sort for it and he asked why i had used merge sort,and asked to improve the code.<br/>Then i gave a min heap solution (:P we discussed after group round). He asked me to code it. I was not good at heaps. I tried my best but unable to arrive at working code<br/>So finally he asked if i had any questions for him. I asked about amazon\xe2\x80\x99s environment.After this i thanked and left.<br/>I was sure that i will be eliminated and i was eliminated.<br/>Only 10 people went to 4th round and 3 people were hired finally.<br/>Here are some mistakes done by me<br/>It was first f2f for me and i was very nervous and had butterflies in stomach, which ultimately decreased my performance.<br/>I was not confident about the answer i gave.<br/>My communication skills were very poor.<br/>So try to avoid the mistakes done by me.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
