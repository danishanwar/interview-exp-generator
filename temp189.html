Count the operations for each element by taking absolute diff. If count of negative numbers is odd and no zeros are there then increase the operations by 2.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>ii) </strong>In a binary tree, find a path between 2 nodes. There was a modification that the height of the tree is infinite and the tree is not in memory.<p>\xc2\xa0 The structure of tree is like :- \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 1<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa02 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 3<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa04 \xc2\xa0 5 \xc2\xa0 6 \xc2\xa0 7\xe2\x80\xa6.. We are given 2 long ints as inputs and we return a vector which is path between them.<p>I discussed with him to go from \xe2\x80\x9cnode to root\xe2\x80\x9d instead of general \xe2\x80\x9croot to node\xe2\x80\x9d. He asked me how and I found out LCA using map and stack.<p>\xc2\xa0 He said the approach is right but he does not want to use map/stack or any derived DS. Use only primitive DS. Solved it using arrays. \xc2\xa0I gave a case where the map-stack approach would be more optimized. So he told me to analyze both the approaches w.r.t. time and space and explain why it is so.<p>Time and space for both approaches were O(log(n)) for the worst case. For average cases and in runtime map-stack would be more optimized and he agreed on it. He asked me to code any of the 2 approaches. I coded the array one as it was simpler to implement. Then he asked if I had any ques and concluded the interview.<p><strong>Round 3(Technical 2) \xe2\x80\x93 remotely :\xc2\xa0</strong><p>No intro, no small talk, straight to coding<p>1. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-distinct-elements-in-every-window-of-size-k/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-distinct-elements-in-every-window-of-size-k/</a><p>\xc2\xa0 No constraints on k &amp; N and was told to handle all possible corner cases.<p>\xc2\xa0 Discussed approach -&gt; coded it -&gt; approved -&gt; discussed time complexity and why it is O(n)<p>2. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-given-tree-to-sum-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-given-tree-to-sum-tree/</a><p>\xc2\xa0 Explained approach -&gt; she asked which traversal will be used and why -&gt; postorder as we calculate left and right child first and then process root -&gt; coded it -&gt; approved<p>3. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/</a><p>\xc2\xa0 Gave the solution with 2 arrays i.e. left-max &amp; right-max. She told me to do it in a single extra array. Did after taking 5 mins. Then she told me to do it in constant space. \xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that was even possible. After trying for 10-12 mins I told her I am getting nowhere. She told me to code the single-array approach.<p>\xc2\xa0 Coded it -&gt; had some logical mistakes -&gt; she gave a direction what the error can be and did a dry run together -&gt; solved it after some time and code was approved.<p>\xc2\xa0 She told me we have some time to think about how to do it in constant space. 10 mins later, the time was up I did not come up with anything and the Interview was over,<p>\xc2\xa0 NO projects, subjects, HR questions<p>Verdict :- Selected<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
