I had applied for this job on naukari.com.<p><strong>Round 1:<br/></strong><p>There was an online codding test on Hackerearth. Two questions were asked. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember them now.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>After two weeks they scheduled a telephonic round.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Question 1: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-number-of-islands/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a matrix of \xe2\x80\x980\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x981\xe2\x80\x99, find the largest Iceland</a> (i.e area of\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x981\xe2\x80\x99s)<p>Question 2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/special-stack/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Design a data structure with constant time for insert, delete, search and getRandom.</a><p>I had given solutions for the both.<p><strong>Round 3 :</strong><p>This was onsite interview at Hyderabad.<p>First he asked about my past projects and challenges faced. He then asked if I had designed anything on top of current a system.<p>Next a technical question was given;<p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-negative-integer-in-every-window-of-size-k/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of integers\xc2\xa0 and a window size \xe2\x80\x98k\xe2\x80\x99, find first negative number for each possible window in the array.</a><p>I first gave him a two queue approach(was not optimal), he told to code it on paper. After I wrote the code, he asked to optimize it further. Finally after few iterations, I gave him an optimal two pointer approach.<p>My suggestion here is; do not hurry to present your solution to interviewer, \xc2\xa0 first try to come-up with best optimal solution. For SDE-2 positions they expect optimal solution at the very first place from you.<p><strong>Round 4 :</strong><p>This was all project and HLD related round.<p>There were two interviewers. The first introduced themselves and told about what their group does at amazon.<p>He then asked about my role at previous company and past projects I did in brief. Then asked if I have done something like adding new functionality or suggested some improvement for the project that was not asked by customer or manager.<p>He then asked me to draw HLD for meeting calendar system. Then there was discussion on various issues on it like scalability, what database should be used; SQL-NoSQL, concurrency etc.<p>\xc2\xa0<p>All the best guys!<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
