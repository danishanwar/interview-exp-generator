I asked him he told that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem ?<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>This what we can do without distance we can at-least find the minimum and maximum time for sensor A and B just traversing an array but after that finding a distance that\xe2\x80\x99s still a\xc2\xa0mystery to me ? in last few minutes he told me take a guess and do it but no enough time.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><br/>Build\xc2\xa0an UBER platform no code discussion about how will you do it,<ol><li>How will handle locations (most updated) of the driver ?<li>How will update the location of the driver (architecture of app or service to update) ?<li>Find nearest driver ?
