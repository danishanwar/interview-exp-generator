There were\xc2\xa0 6 rounds for me 1 written round 3 f2f technical rounds and 2 online rounds on amazon chime.<p><strong>Round 1: (written round )\xc2\xa0 </strong>Two easy questions were given in this round there was no limit in the time but i submitted it in around 25 minutes.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-triplets-array-whose-sum-equal-zero/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-triplets-array-whose-sum-equal-zero/</a><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-two-linked-lists/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-two-linked-lists/</a><p><strong>Round 2: ( f2f ) two questions were asked in this round\xc2\xa0</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/\xc2\xa0</a><p>this question i had already had solved earlier so i told him the soln a bit quickly.other question was something like given a set of fishes which moves in either right or left direction and every fish has a size associated with it and the bigger fish eats the smaller fishes if they are facing in opposite direction. the question was to find the remaining fishes in the end. I came up with a solution using stack and they were much satisfied with that.<p><strong>Round 3: ( f2f ) two question were asked in this round.</strong><p><strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-for-linked-list/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-for-linked-list/</a>\xc2\xa0</strong><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-integers-running-integers/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-integers-running-integers/</a><p>the interviewer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that friendly in this round so i messed up in the second question a little bit after these question he asked few questions related to operating system and i answered those but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very satisfied.<p><strong>Round 4</strong>:<strong> ( f2f )\xc2\xa0</strong>three question were asked in this round which were from dp, linkedlist and binary search.<p>the first question was\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-binary-strings-without-consecutive-1s/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-binary-strings-without-consecutive-1s/</a>\xc2\xa0 2nd was find the element of linked list which is at the position squareroot(len(linkedlist))\xc2\xa0 in one iteration and the third question was on binary search which i dont really remember. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen any of these questions earlier so it took me a little time for solving these question. and then he asked me a few questions related to my project. he was pretty impressed.<p><strong>Round 5</strong>: this was the easiest among all the interviews<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-a-and-a-number-x-check-for-pair-in-a-with-sum-as-x/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-a-and-a-number-x-check-for-pair-in-a-with-sum-as-x/\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</a><p>and the second question was about finding the first number which is common between two linked lists.i\xc2\xa0 told him a solution using hashing and he was pretty much satisfied with that and then he asked me some questions from dbms like acid properties and normalisation.<p><strong>Round 6: (Bar raiser round)</strong><p>the first question was given a playlist of songa you have to randomise the list and play every song once until all the songs in the playlist are done. the second question was\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-stack-using-recursion/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-stack-using-recursion/</a>\xc2\xa0and last question was finding the first missing number given the starting value and the sorted list. i told him a solution using binary search and he was pretty satisfied with that. and after that he asked me few questions related to internship which i was able to answer.<p>for each round i was told to write code for the programs except for the 4th round\xe2\x80\x99s last question.\xc2\xa0after 8 days of the last interview i got a call from the hr that i have been selected for the sde1 role at amazon hyderabad. I was a bit lucky in the sense that i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked\xc2\xa0 questions from computer networks which is one of my weaker subjects.\xc2\xa0 i would suggest every one to keep practising and try to maintain a calm attitude while giving the interviews.<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
