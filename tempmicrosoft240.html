Just a matter of fact, everyone got a different set of three questions, better run-time and space complexity was awarded higher marks.<br/>The set of three questions for me was \xe2\x80\x93<br/><font face="georgia" size=""><ul><li><i>Given n and m, find the nearest number to n which is divisible by m. If there exist two numbers at same distance, output the greater one.</i><li><i>Given an integer n, if the binary representatino of this number is a palindrome, then find the number of ones. You are required to accomplish the task without using any data structure.</i><li><i>Given a binary tree, find the length of the smallest path from the root to a leaf node with a given sum, in constant space.</i></li></li></li></ul><p></p></font><p>A lot of students were shortlisted from this round as doing all the three questions wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too tough here.</p></div><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="4"></font></p><li><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Coding Round</b><p><div style="margin-left:45px">It was an offline written coding round with 2 questions. Do write clean and correct codes, with appropriate names for variables and proper indentation.<br/>The questions were \xe2\x80\x93<br/><font face="georgia"><ul><li><i>Given a string as \xe2\x80\x9cBeing in an IIT worths a lot\xe2\x80\x9d, convert it to \xe2\x80\x9clot a worths IIT an in Being\xe2\x80\x9d.

An alert to be ready for surprises \xe2\x80\x93 the selection procedure wasn\xe2\x80\x99t transparent enough for you to be confident in getting an entry to the next round. What I mean to say is, many among those who were shortlisted did it Wrong, and many others who did everthing fine weren\xe2\x80\x99t granted an entry.</div><p><font face="trebuchet ms" size="4"></font></p><li><b>Interviews</b><p><div style="margin-left:35px">I went through three rounds of interviews with different persons, with around 2 questions in each round. The third round also had a discussion over my projects.<br/><br/>The standard ones \xe2\x80\x93<br/><font face="georgia"><ul><li><i>Join all nodes at same level in a binary tree. Do this iteratively with constant extra space.</i><li><i>Find whether u and v are connected in a directed graph, if yes, print the path.</i></li></li></ul><p></p></font><br/>A bit interesting than those above-<br/><font face="georgia"><ul><li><i>Do the first question of the written coding round without using ANY extra space, in O(length of string).</i><br/>It\xe2\x80\x99s intersting just bcoz it\xe2\x80\x99s something different.<li><i>How would you implement a LRU cache?</i></li></li></ul><p></p></font></div><p>Apart from these things, they also considerd the CGPA for the final shortlisting.<br/><p>This article is contributed by <strong>Shivam Dubey</strong>.
