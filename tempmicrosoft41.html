Complete to solve this problem</li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3:-</strong><ul><li>I introduce my self and we both are from the same college (NITK)<li>Then he move to the programing question which is you have given two singly linked list and you have to add these two linked list the constraints you can\xe2\x80\x99t modify the input linked list list1 =&gt; \xc2\xa09-&gt;5-&gt;4 list2 =&gt; 8-&gt;0-&gt;7 resulted list =&gt; 1-&gt;7-&gt;6-&gt;1 **you can\xe2\x80\x99t modify the input linked list**<li>then he ask me to develop the programing language which has a maximum throughput, we have discussion on this problem to what data structure we can use.</li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 4:-</strong><ul><li>This is hiring manager round but not looks like hiring manager round \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<li>He started with the problem and the problem was you have given the matrix of n*n which contains the small character only and you have given the dictionary as well which contain the English valid word, you have to find the how many word can be formed using this matrix, the word must contain in dictionary, you can move in matrix to left, right, top, bottom and diagonal<li>t o p<li>a g i<li>b r g<li>the possible Words are:- 1. top 2. tab 3. bat 4. pig 5. bag 6. gip<li>discussion about what data structure you have to use for Dictionary and i have solve this problem by using of DFS. and for dictionary i have used the Trie data structure.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>After 2 days of all round complete, I got a call from HR and I got <strong>Selected</strong> in Microsoft, Dreams Come True.<p>Be focus on codding and all edge case passes.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
