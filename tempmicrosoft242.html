If two nearest valid numbers are equal then double the value of the first one and make the second number as 0.At last move all the valid numbers on the left.<br/>Eg:<br/>Input : 2 4 5 0 0 5 4 8 6 0 6 8<br/>Output : 2 4 10 4 8 12 8 0 0 0 0 0<p>2) In a given linked list which contains zero values in some nodes calculate sum of values between two zeros and replace the zero value in the linked list by that sum.<br/>Eg: 7 0 4 5 6 0 1 1 will become 7 15 1 1.<br/>The zeros are always present in pairs.<p>3) Given a linked list with each node containing coordinates of x,y plane. Remove middle points.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><pre>Input:  (0,10)-&gt;(1,10)-&gt;(5,10)-&gt;(7,10)\r\n                                  |\r\n                                (7,5)-&gt;(20,5)-&gt;(40,5)\r\nOutput: Linked List should be changed to following\r\n        (0,10)-&gt;(7,10)\r\n                  |\r\n                (7,5)-&gt;(40,5)</pre><p><strong>Round 2 Group fly</strong><br/>There were 2 questions which had to be coded on paper.<br/>1) Given a sentence . Print in vertically without using equivalent amount of extra space.<pre>\r\nInput:  "Welcome to Microsoft" \r\nOutput : \r\nW  t   m\r\ne   o    i\r\nl         c\r\nc        r\t\r\no       o\r\nm      s\r\ne       o\r\n         f \r\n         t\r\n</pre><p>2) Given an arbitrary lexical order of character \xe2\x80\x9d b s a z c \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98ng\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98st\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9d<p>Here ng and st are to be considered as single characters.<p>You are given this order and two strings and you have to output<p>+1 is str1 str2<p>0 if str1 == str2<p><strong>Round 3</strong><br/>The interviewer was very cool.He made me feel very relaxed.He asked me about my project which was<p>about reinforcement learning. I answered his queries.<p>Then he gave me 2 simple questions to code. I coded both of them easily.<p>1) Print boundary traversal of a binary tree.<p>2) Reverse a linked list in sets of k nodes.<br/>He asked me about corner cases and what all test cases will I try when testing this code. He asked me if I had any questions, I asked a couple.<p><strong>Round 4</strong><br/>This time the interviewer seemed strict and asked me how my previous rounds went.<p>I answered they were good but he seemed to doubt me.<p>Then he gave me a question to code.<p>Count all possible paths from top left to bottom right in a m X n matrix.<p>I directly jumped to the dp solution which required O(m X n) space.<p>Then he said if I knew the question , I said yes then he told me that I should have told him I knew the question.<p>He did not seem pleased with my answer and asked me to do it in less space O(m)<p>I did that then he added to the question that some grid points contain obstacles and we cannot go through those.<p>I solved this too. Then he asked me to do it in O(1) space.I told him that we can do it recusively but that would shoot up the time complexity.<p>He said that I code it and show him the answer.I did it but he still did not seem satisfied and asked me \xe2\x80\x9d Are you sure this will work\xe2\x80\x9d<p>I said that I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a dry run for the code and I drew a recursion tree for the same. After that he said that the time is up and I should wait outside.<p><strong>Round 5</strong><br/>This was a technical + HR round. He asked me the generic question \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d.<p>Then he asked me about grep function in Unix which searches a string in set of files.<p>He asked what approach I would use to search a string in a set of files.<p>I told him about Tries and Ternary trees, I also mentioned that Windows performs indexing which makes search faster and this is stored in the secondary memory.<br/>then he told me that tries and ternary trees are stored in the primary memory and will vanish after rebooting the system,so how will i store them into the secondary memory.<p>I told him about serialzation and deserialization process and gave an example of a binary tree.<p>He seemed satisfied and did not ask me to code.<p>I would like to Thank GeeksforGeeks for helping me in interview preparation.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using <a href="http://www.contribute.geeksforgeeks.org">contribute.geeksforgeeks.org</a> or mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
