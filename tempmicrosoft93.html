The scope of syllabus was unknown so they can ask you stuff not yet covered in your semesters.\xc2\xa0 In my case the first question was, differentiate threads and processes based on OS theory.\xc2\xa0 I failed to answer, as OS was to be covered in sixth semester.\xc2\xa0 Next question was, sort two arrays by comparing array elements (compare element of one array with the other array).\xc2\xa0 This was out of my thinking, so I failed to answer.\xc2\xa0 Next question was, print the skeleton of binary tree (one perfect algorithm, no patch work).\xc2\xa0 We needed to come up with a algorithm on-site.\xc2\xa0 This was unique as all sites feature code which are broken into two parts.\xc2\xa0 The last question was on building queue from any no. of stacks. (The hint is no. of stacks required is 2). For dequeue simply pop elements of stack, insert element and again push to stack.\xc2\xa0 For enqueue, simply push element onto stack.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>I was rejected in Round 2.\xc2\xa0 So couldn\xe2\x80\x99t appear in Round 3.\xc2\xa0 Round 3 was on-site interview with HR and technical.<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><p>Be thoroughly prepared as questions asked in Round 2 and Round 3 will be out of your league.\xc2\xa0 Be prepared to face them.\xc2\xa0 Only one well versed in International courses and having depth of topics can crack it.<p>\xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
