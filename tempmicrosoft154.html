They set CGPA cut off as 7 for applying.<p><strong>Round-1(Online test)</strong><p>The first online round was on Co-Cubes ( a very bad platform with no option of custom input as well.) which comprised of 3 coding questions (Test Duration: 75 mins). Not all the questions were same, Different students had different questions. We just had to complete the functions for all the problems. You can choose your language between C, C++, Java and C#, :-<ol><li>2 marks \xe2\x80\x93<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/round-the-given-number-to-nearest-multiple-of-10/"> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/round-the-given-number-to-nearest-multiple-of-10/\xc2\xa0</a><li>3 marks \xe2\x80\x93 Given a date in the format (DD/MM/YYYY), find the day of the week.

Then he asked me about OOPS \xe2\x80\x93 things like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Protected, Static variable etc. He also gave me another question, I do not remember that one! Sorry.<p>This was a long interview of more than an hour, as the interviewer was discussed a lot of things with me including Azure.<p><strong>Round 5: Non-Technical Interview</strong><ol>This was like an HR round. The interview asked me my expectations of internship, my projects and interests in computer science. He asked me a lot of things about why computer science, on my favorite technology and other stuff. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me any specific question to solve but kept on asking questions like this. It was about 30 minutes of interview.</ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
