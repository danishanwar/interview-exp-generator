Three coding questions were asked.</ol></p><li>Given a Linked List of integers, write a function to modify the linked list in-place such that all odd numbers appear before all the even numbers in the modified linked list. The relative order of even and odd numbers should remain the same.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segregate-even-and-odd-elements-in-a-linked-list/">Segregate Even Odd nodes in a Linked List</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-a-perfect-square/">Given a floating point number, calculate its square root without using in-built sqrt() function</a>.<li>Given a pattern string and a test string, implement RegEx substring matching. If the pattern is\xc2\xa0preceded by a ^, it will match with the starting position. Similarly, if it is preceded by a $, it will match\xc2\xa0the ending position. If no such markers are present, it will check whether pattern is a substring of test.<br/>Ex : ^coal<br/>coaltar<br/>Result : True<br/>tar$<br/>coaltar<br/>Result : True<br/>abcd<br/>efgh<br/>Result : False<p>25 students were selected for the next round.<p><strong>Round 2(paper coding round):</strong><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree/">Print boundary traversal of Binary tree in clockwise direction</a>.(Note: check for leaf nodes in left and right traversal for a given tree).<li>Rotate a square image 90 degree clockwise. Optimize as much as u can.<br/>8 students were selected for further rounds.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3 \xe2\x80\x93 PI1</strong><ol><li>Discussed about the 1st question asked in paper coding round, i.e., Boundary traversal of Binary tree.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-balanced-binary-search-trees/">How to merge two BSTs </a>. Asked me all the approaches that I was able to implement . Then asked me to do in O(logn), where n is total no. of nodes .<li>Asked me to write code to find a no. occurring greater than n/2 times in an array . Then asked me to prove the written algorithm , basically , he was asking how I was able to write that code and why is it working .<br/>7 students were selected for further rounds.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong><br/>Round 4-PI2</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Asked me to implement seat booking process in BOOKMYSHOW.com . How to handle the cases where two persons are trying to access the same seat at almost same time . He told me to write class based solution asking about different functions that should be used to solve all the cases for booking procedure .<li>What is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-class-java/">singleton class</a>?<li>How to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-point-of-intersection-of-two-lines/">find the point of intersection of two line segments</a> . Two end points of line segments were given.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-of-occurrences-of-2-as-a-digit-in-numbers-from-0-to-n/">How to find no. of 2\xe2\x80\x99s between nos. 1 to n</a> . He gave me few hints and finally , he was satisfied with my approach .<li>he asked me to implement fibonacci series considering every possible solution .<br/>And few more questions were asked , but I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember them.<p>6 students were selected for further rounds</p></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>.<p><strong>Round 5:PI3</strong><ol><li>Write function for <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion/">inorder traversal of Binary tree without recursion</a>. That was easy !!<li>Asked me a puzzle question. An n*n board is given and one of the given cells is black . Also , L shaped pieces are given (equivalent to 3 cells of given matrix) , considering all possible rotations. I had to fill the entire grid using those pieces . Pieces can\xe2\x80\x99t be placed on the black cell and no two pieces should overlap , not even partially . I gave an answer where I tried to increase the size of unaccesible cells( black cells and already placed pieces on board) to the size of the given board , but he asked me few cases where my answer failed. Then I said him we can do the exhaustive search of combinations using backtracking but it will take too much time . Then he gave me clue that instead of growing the size of unaccesible cells, try to decrease it. Finally , I concluded that it divide-n-conquer based solution considering base case as 2*2 board with 1 black cell.<p>4 students were selected for further rounds.</p></li></li></ol><p><strong><br/>Round 6 : PI4</strong><ol><li>he told me to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/">implement LRU Cache </a>. I gave him all the solutions that can be possible . He was very helpful . He found flaws and told me to optimize it. I gave him 3 solutions and the final one is the one which you can find anywhere on the internet. But before that , he asked me to swap two nodes of a DLL using hashmap . I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what Lru Cache is initially . haha</li></ol><p><strong>Round 7 : PI5 and final round</strong><ol><li>What\xe2\x80\x99s your passion ? What you want to do in your life ? Hr-type question .<li>He designed a new language with the words of English and stored them in an array of strings . Then he gave me two strings and told me to design strcmp function . I told him the best method in one go , but he tried to confuse me and he was successful . He gave me 5 mins to come up with another solution and tried new one . Lastly , I implemented the first approach I had in mind and he was satisfied with it.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialize-deserialize-n-ary-tree/">How to serialize and deserialize an n-ary tree</a> . I told him the function for serializing and deserializing a binary tree but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with solution for the given problem.<p>P.S : I was not comfortable with OS and DBMS , so I told them clearly but they tried to ask indirectly all the basic questions of OS and DBMS , and told me to implement them using C/C++.</p></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Questions asked to my friends :</strong><ol><li>Developing an algorithm for crossing bridges problem , where no. of elements is n.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-get-the-intersection-point-of-two-linked-lists/">Intersection of two linked lists</a>.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-and-remove-loop-in-a-linked-list/">Find if loop is present in linked list and also , find the start node of the loop in it </a>.<li>Class design for banking system.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/">Reverse linked list using both recursion and iteration </a>.</li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>And many more.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
