It is an invite-only challenge, so \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to be chosen\xe2\x80\x9d by Google.<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no specific word from Google, but it\xe2\x80\x99s said that, based on your search history, i.e., your problem-solving related search keywords, their algorithm may find your searches interesting and send you the invite.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Don\xe2\x80\x99t find Foobar, let Foobar find you!</strong><ul><li>Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the thing we are actually interested in. It starts with a story where the villain (Commander Lambda) is trying to take over a bunny planet and has enslaved the bunnies. The task is to save the bunnies. You have infiltrated the villain\xe2\x80\x99s ship and now have to solve a few problems to rescue the bunnies and escape. There are 5 levels in the challenge with increasing difficulty.<li>In the first level, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get ONE fairly easy question. It can be completed then and there within an hour (max) or so . When I took the challenge for the first time, I was given 2 days (48 hours) to complete the problem.<li>The second level had questions related to the famous algorithms Breadth first search and Depth first search with a little bit of linear algebra. You get three days for each of the two questions. You get a referral link through which you can let a friend enter foobar!<li>The third level had questions of number theory, dynamic programming, and even steady-state machines. Here you get three questions, you get seven days for each. It scared me at first, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that difficult if you are active in competitive programming.<li>After the third level you get an option to share your contact details with google\xe2\x80\x99s recruitment team<li>Currently, I am on Level 4th and I have already solved one of the three problems\xc2\xa0</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Some tips:</strong><ol><li>Don\xe2\x80\x99t Overthink: Overthinking can make you use algorithms that might be overkill. For one question I went on to implement Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s Blossom algorithm while all I needed was a simple depth first search based bipartite matching. All the questions in foobar are mostly solvable in under 400 lines of code.<li>Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it is the only way into Google<li>Refer to the internet when you don\xe2\x80\x99t know<li>Try to learn the concepts and then start solving. This challenge will surely teach you a lot. You might hit a question that you have no idea about. The internet will be a friend, but don\xe2\x80\x99t let it spoil you.<li>Also try to go for the challenge when you have ample of time to work on it only and try to learn at each step.</li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Foobar is more about learning and implementing, instead of knowing everything before!</strong><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
