I named few Data Structures including Segment Tree. Then he asked me about segment trees and how to solve some simple problems based on segment trees, He asked only about approach didn\xe2\x80\x99t asked me to code. Then he asked me about<p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/connect-nodes-at-same-level/1">Connect Nodes at Same Level</a><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>I told him approach using level order traversal. Then he asked me to connect nodes on same level but this time to their left sibling. After telling my approach he asked me to code and said that he want code free of any errors. After I gave him my code he pointed out that there are some errors in code. He asked me to find and correct them myself.<br/>Then he asked another question:<p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/1">Diameter of Binary Tree</a><p>After hearing my approach for this question he asked me to print leaves that correspond to diameter.<p><strong>Round 3(F2F)</strong><br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/special-stack/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Only one question was asked in this round. She asked me to implement a data structure that can perform 1) Insert (O(1))2) Delete (O(1))3) Count(O(1))4) Get Element(O(1))on integer inputs. Here Get Element returns any element present in DS.</a><br/>I told her my approaches using array, single linked list with hashing and using two singly linked list and hashing. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach exact solution but she was satisfied with my approach.<p>Solution to this problem was easy using doubly linked list and hashing.<p>After this round a total of 19 students were selected for internship.<p><strong>TIPS:</strong><ul><li>Think before you speak<li>Be honest during interview<li>Stay Calm<li>Take hints from interviewers<p>Finally, I would like to thank Geeksforgeeks for helping me with my preparation ?<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
