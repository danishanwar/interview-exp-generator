But I had read months earlier how Amazon was established and was able to satisfy him with answer.<li>2 ques- Tell me about Summer Intern at wipro- It took around 20 min. Deep discussion on project, all in and out.<li>3 Ques- How does the program gets compiled internally, I told him I have not studies this part as my branch is ECE.He then asked me what have you studied- I told him DS algo ,OS, Networks and convinced him that ECE is strongly related with CS in terms of Algorithm.<li>4 ques- As i told him that I like competitive coding, He asked tell me 1 quess you have solved- I told him- Find the K-most frequent occurring word till now in a\xc2\xa0running stream of words\xc2\xa0by using Trie(modified) and Heap concept. He asked why I am using min heap and not Max heap and I gave the reason.<li>Everything about Min Heap-&gt; Insertion deletion modification.<li>Given data How will you sort them. I told him quick sort , merge sort are possible ways.He asked which you will prefer I told him QuickSort .Why not Merge sort? I told\xc2\xa0him because of external memory use but then he asked that can\xe2\x80\x99t we do it in-place , later on I was able to do inplace merge sort and he again asked which algo you will prefer I told still quicksort because it is more Cache Friendly and he was satisfied.<li>Given 100 gb data, you need to sort them how will you proceed. I told him external sorting and he straight away told me I don\xe2\x80\x99t want merge sort. Then I tried to twist the situation by asking what type of data is available. He was in doubt why am I asking that, So I told him if all the data is in limited range then I can simply apply<br/>counting sort and he was impressed as well he forgot about the actual question. \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b<li>He was done with the interview and said do you have any ques. ME- What role will be playing in the team if selected.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>In 2 min They told me that i was cleared for 2 round.<p><strong>Round 2</strong><br/>I went for 2 round without wasting time as Spot On offers were to be given. Interviewer was slightly weired and he straight on went for the ques.<br/>There is data available for different vehicles and all vehicles have n parameters which distinguish it with other vehicle so given huge data you need to separate them in different<br/>lists based on some parameters matching. How will you proceed-&gt;Then he said 3 parameters are there and if all 3 parameters match then they belong to same list.<br/>I told him lets sort the data according to first parameter then for then sort acc to 2 para and so on..(something like Radix sort).<br/>He told me to use Hash-Map and model the whole idea\xe2\x80\xa6.building the structure for each vehicle and then use key to do hash-mapping.<br/>I implemented it but due to too much overwriting, He was not looking impressed but he told its correct.<br/>DO u have any questions.<br/>After this Round I was rejected.<p>TIPS-<ol><li>Please be prepared for Hash_MAP it is very important to have deep knowledge as\xc2\xa0 this part is rarely covered in.<li>Try to write clean codes and by clean code I mean you shoud use good variable name, dont scribble much and try to write comments along with it.(I made a mistake here.)<li>You should know all in and outs of the project and remember interview can ask any project.<li>Puzzles don\xe2\x80\x99t matter much\xe2\x80\xa6</li></li></li></li></ol><p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
