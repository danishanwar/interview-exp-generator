The interview process was easy and well structured. Though the questions are easy the interviewer explored all the intricacies and I had to write full code for all the cases. Taking care of corner cases and optimizing time and space complexities. Each round went for 45min to 1 hr.\nMy suggestion will be brush up your basics. Don\'t try to write down the optimized code at the very beginning. give a simple solution first and gradually optimize it.\nIf you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
