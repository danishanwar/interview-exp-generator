Write full code and asked me to execute some given test cases.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LRU cache.</a> Again full code with test cases.<li>There was some time left so he asked me to provide another approach for 2nd problem.</li></li></li></li></ol><p><em><strong>Got an onsite call for Hyderabad.</strong></em><p>By all these rounds the interviewer keeps a laptop with him and keeps on writing the feedback.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2:\xc2\xa0</strong><p><strong><em>Project based discussion:</em></strong><ol><li>Introduce yourself.<li>Explain the working of your current project.

It will work fine.<li>Then asked to optimise it further.
