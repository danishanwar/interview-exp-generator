Following was my experience:<p><strong>Round 1:</strong><br/>This was a written round. Everyone was given the following two questions:<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-distance-k-given-node-binary-tree/">Find all the nodes at a distance k from a given node</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-of-numbers-arrange-the-numbers-to-form-the-biggest-number/">Given an array, arrange the elements such that the number formed by concatenating the elements is highest.</a> E.g.: input = [9, 93, 24, 6], the output should be: [9,93,6,24]. This is because if you concatenate all the numbers, 993624 is the highest number that can be formed.</li></li></ol><p>40 minutes was given for this round. However, if you request, they were giving extra time. After this round, lunch was served.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><ol>This was a face to face round. Almost everyone from first round was called in for the F2F interview. After a brief introduction, he asked me this question:<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><li>Given an array with huge data (say n, where n can be upto a million), the values in the array are in the range of 1-k where k&lt;&lt;&lt;n, sort the array. I gave a solution with binary trees but then he asked for more solutions and finally was satisfied when I gave him a solution with<br/>O(k) extra space.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern/">He asked another question about thread safe singleton class</a> and asked me to write a code for it and explain it.<li>Then a few questions were asked about why Microsoft and similar stuff.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3:</strong><br/>I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the question properly but it was something about arrays and swapping and finding the minimum cost possible.<p><strong>Round 4:</strong><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindrome-substring-set-1/">Longest Palindrome Substring set 1</a><p>However, the interviewer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in the code. He asked me to do a TDD for this problem. So he asked me to write test cases for this problem. He wanted to see if I can really analyze and find the various possible cases for this problem. After some struggle, I was able to find various different type of test cases. I gave a brute force solution.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Round 5:</strong><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/">Maximum difference between two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number</a><p>However, I gave a different solution than the one mentioned in this page.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Round 6:</strong><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdstring-class-in-c/">Write the implementation of String class.</a> Implement any four methods of your choice.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-your-own-tail-read-last-n-lines-of-a-huge-file/">Write a code for the tail method of linux</a> where you have to read some x lines of huge files from the end without reading the entire file. I gave some solutions based on indexing. The interviewer was very friendly and helped a lot in arriving at the solution.<p>Since it was quite late by the time this interview was over, they arranged a cab for me to go back home.</p></li></li></ol><p>Overall, the experience was very nice. The interviewers and the HR were very friendly.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
