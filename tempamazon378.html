We were shared a link for the test hosted on HackerEarth. The pattern of the test was 20 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s and 2 Programming Questions.<p><strong>Online Test:</strong><p>20 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s based on OS, Network, COA, DBMS, OOPS.<p>Q1: Given a NxM Grid. The grid consists of only 3 integers(0, 1, 2)<ul><li>0 denotes empty cell.<li>1 denotes a cell containing plant.<li>2 represents a cell where you are standing currently.</li></li></li></ul><p>You can move to adjacent cells (Up, Down, Left, Right). Find the length of the shortest path to reach one of the boundaries without stepping on a plant.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Length of the path is the number of moves you make.<p>Q2: You are given some rules (&lt;=26) an integer K.You can make several permutations of the rules while keeping the given rules fixed.<p>Write a program to find the Kth lexicographically smallest permutations of the rules.<p>Eg.<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Input:<br/></span>bcd (Rule)<br/>xyz (Rule)<br/>1 (K)<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Output:<br/></span>axyzbcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Explanation:<br/></span>Alphabets b, c, d have already been mapped to be represented x, y, z respectively. Now we need to find the lexicographically smallest (K=1) permutation of the alphabet. This is done if we assign each remaining alphabet to the earliest possible position in the permutation. Hence, the answer is\xc2\xa0<span style="text-decoration:underline">axyzbcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</span>.<p>I got the first question complete and the second question partial which was enough to qualify for the face to face interview.<p><strong>Round 1:</strong><p>Q1: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/zigzag-tree-traversal/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZigZag Tree Traversal</a><p>Q2:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-tree-to-dll/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Binary Tree to DLL</a><p>I answered them both.<br/>The interviewer first asked me to think of the approach and explain that approach to him.Once he was satisfied with the approach, He asked me to write production level code.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>Q1: Given a list of IP addresses [192.12.23.45, 234.23.56.89, \xe2\x80\xa6 ]. Remove duplicate IP\xe2\x80\x99s in the list.<p>Sol: I gave the first answer that store the IP addresses in a set while iterating and if IP is found in set, remove it.<br/>However, Interviewer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied with the space complexity so he told me to reduce the space complexity.<br/>I came up with a tries based solution where instead of storing an IP in set, I store it in Trie.(Space complexity is reduced as Node in Trie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take up space unless allotted a value as well as instead of creating a new node for every IP, in Trie a node can be reused if even half of the IP is same).<p>Q2:<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-path-sum/1"> Maximum path sum</a><br/>(Without Space Complexity)<p>Solved the first question completely but took more time, so couldn\xe2\x80\x99t solve the second question on time.<p><b>Verdict: Rejected</b><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
