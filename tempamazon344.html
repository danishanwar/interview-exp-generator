Yes, most of the interviews for technical roles in these companies are focused on measuring the <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> knowledge of the candidates. \xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<blockquote><p>So the question arises: <strong>Why do Product Based Companies place so much emphasis on Data Structures and Algorithms?</strong></p></blockquote><p><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20190515174003/Learning-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-is-Important.png"/><p style="text-align:justify">Software Product Based Companies normally create products that are related to software. So it stands to reason that they require quality <strong>Software Developers</strong> to handle the development process for the software. The pay-scale of Software Developers has increased a lot in recent times globally. According to the report by Glassdoor, the average base pay of Software Developers in India is found to be around <strong>12 Lakhs </strong><i><strong>per annum</strong></i>. The average base of software developers ranges from <strong>Rs. 4,00,000</strong> to <strong>Rs 20,00,000</strong> per year (With Product Based Companies occupying the higher end of the spectrum).<br/>\xc2\xa0<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width:810px"><img sizes="100vw" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210624131130/GlassdoorImage.png" srcset="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210624131130/GlassdoorImage-660x213.png 660w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210624131130/GlassdoorImage-768x248.png 768w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210624131130/GlassdoorImage.png," width="852"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Image Courtesy: Glassdoor</p></div><p style="text-align:justify">However, there is an acute shortage of well-qualified Software developers in India. As per various standard reports, less than 10% of engineers are actually employable in software-related jobs. <strong>That is where Data Structures and Algorithms come in.</strong> They are so important in Product Based Companies\xe2\x80\x99 interviews as they are the hallmark of any good Software Developer.\xc2\xa0<p style="text-align:justify">In addition to that, there are multiple reasons why <strong>Product Based Companies</strong> place so much emphasis on Data Structures and Algorithms as stated below:\xc2\xa0<ol><li style="text-align:justify">Data Structures and Algorithms demonstrate the <strong>problem-solving ability</strong> of a candidate. There is no room to craft elaborate stories and this means that either the candidate can solve the problem or they can\xe2\x80\x99t.<li style="text-align:justify">Questions based on Data Structures and Algorithms can be <strong>scaled up or down</strong> according to the knowledge level of the candidate. This means that a variety of candidates can be tested using roughly the same problems.<li style="text-align:justify">Data Structures and Algorithms are used to test the <strong>analytical skills</strong> of the candidates as they are a useful tool to pick out the underlying algorithms in real-world problems and solve them efficiently.<li style="text-align:justify">Data Structures and Algorithms are the <strong>fundamentals</strong> of Software Development. They remain the same no matter what new technology is used and that puts the focus on the problem rather than the technology in the interview process.</li></li></li></li></ol><h3 style="text-align:center">Learning Data Structures and Algorithms</h3><p style="text-align:justify">Now as we have established that Data Structures and Algorithms are important for interviews in <strong>Product Based Companies</strong>, let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on learning them.\xc2\xa0<blockquote><p style="text-align:justify">Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:justify">While learning Data Structures and Algorithms, it is best to start small with simple topics and then move on to more and more advanced topics. Some of the basic data structures are <strong>Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, </strong>etc. while some of the basic algorithms are <strong>Sorting, Searching, </strong>etc.\xc2\xa0<p>Some of the major problems that can appear while learning Data Structures and Algorithms are:\xc2\xa0<ul><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Lack of guidance: </strong>There is no clear guidance while learning Data Structures and Algorithms. There are numerous topics within these umbrella terms with no specific guidelines about which topics would be more useful for different Product Based Companies. This situation can be quite confusing, especially for a beginner.<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>No idea from where to start learning: </strong>Even if the necessary topics in Data Structures and Algorithms are known, the sheer amount of them leads to a lot of confusion. Most beginners have no idea from where to start learning or even what chronological order to follow while learning.</li></li></ul><p style="text-align:justify">To solve the above problems, we at GeeksforGeeks have designed a number of online courses to learn Data Structures and Algorithms at affordable prices.
