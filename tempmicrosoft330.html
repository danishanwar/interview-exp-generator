There were 6 rounds in total for me.<p><strong>Objective Round :-</strong><br/>The objective round was taken in Cocubes.com, there were 15 questions (1 question was repeated in my set). There was a question about \xe2\x80\x9cRectangular Collisions in an array\xe2\x80\x9d which I had no idea about.<p><strong>Coding Round :-</strong><br/>There were two coding questions :-<br/>1) Find an element in a sorted array which has been rotated circularly at only one location in O(logn) time.<br/>(Refer <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/</a>)<p>2) Find the inorder successor of a node in a Binary Search Tree.<br/>(Parent pointers were present in the BST). (Refer Method 1 of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-successor-in-binary-search-tree/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-successor-in-binary-search-tree/</a>)<p><strong>Group Interview Round :-</strong><br/>First 10 minutes, he asked about what we expect to be the next big thing in technology. Then he gave two questions :-<br/>1) Given a string, you have to check if it is a valid number or not.(The number can be signed, floating point/integer). If it is a number return true else return false.<br/>The constraints were :-<br/>i) No decision statements allowed (No if-else,no switch-case).<br/>ii) No ternary conditional operators allowed (? : not allowed).<br/>iii) No looping statements allowed (No for/while/do-while).<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>(My solution was a recursive implementation returning a bool having only one return statement using relational operators and two global variables, one for checking if it is the first occurrence of a \xe2\x80\x98.\xe2\x80\x99 and other for checking if the sign \xe2\x80\x98+\xe2\x80\x99/\xe2\x80\x99-\xe2\x80\x98 occurs in 1st location or not).<p>2) Bing wants to improve the experience of users by giving reward points to users. Devise an algorithm to assign reward points to different users.<p><strong>Personal Interview Round I :-</strong><br/>1) You are given a string containing only \xe2\x80\x98(\xe2\x80\x98 and \xe2\x80\x98)\xe2\x80\x99, check if the string is well formed,i.e. check if the parenthesis is well matched.<br/>(Either have a count of \xe2\x80\x98(\xe2\x80\x98 or use a stack for pushing \xe2\x80\x98(\xe2\x80\x98 and popping when \xe2\x80\x98)\xe2\x80\x99 is encountered).<p>2) There is a Bot Class with the following prototype :-<pre>class Bot {\r\n// private data members\r\npublic :\r\n bool moveleft(); // The bot moves one block left and returns true.\r\n bool moveright(); // The bot moves one block right and returns true.\r\n bool movebottom(); // The bot moves one block down and returns true.\r\n bool movetop(); // The bot moves one block up and returns true.\r\n bool hasGold(); // returns true if the current position of bot has gold.\r\n};</pre><p>You are given a bot and the dimension of a maze having walls and some blocks having gold, check if the bot can reach a block containing gold.<p>(Use dfs graph traversal using the recursive implementation and return true if the current position has gold and return false only if you cannot move any further).<p><strong>Personal Interview Round II :-</strong><br/>1) You are given the roots of two binary trees, check if the trees are isomorphic or not.(Initially he framed the question for a tree (not a binary tree) and gave me two random nodes instead of the roots).<p>(Refer https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-isomorphism-problem/)<p>2) You are given an array of n X m dimension. You start from (0,0)th location. You can move from (i,j) to any of (i + 1,j),(i,j + 1),(i + 1,j + 1)th locations. Find the total number of paths starting from (0,0)th to (i,j)th position.<p>(For all i and j,dp[i][0] = dp[0][j] = 1, dp[i][j] = dp[i \xe2\x80\x93 1][j \xe2\x80\x93 1] + dp[i][j \xe2\x80\x93 1] + dp[i \xe2\x80\x93 1][j]).<p><strong>Personal Interview Round III :-</strong><br/>1) Given a dictionary, group the anagrams together.<br/>(Sort each string in dictionary, as anagrams will have same representation after sorting, use a hash map to store the groups of anagrams).<br/>2) He asked questions related to my project.<p>Thank You geeksforgeeks.org.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
