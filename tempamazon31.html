Then he directly moved on to the questions.<p>Two questions were asked<ul><li>https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/. I gave 3 approaches of varying time complexities from O(nm) to O(log n + log m). It\xe2\x80\x99s always better to provide all the approaches to the interviewer from brute force to fully optimized than giving the most optimized solution straight away.<li>https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/. I struggled a bit on this question but kept thinking out loud. As there was less time left, the interviewer gave me a hint and I was easily able to explain and code the solution after that.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Technical Interview Round 2: </strong>The interview started in a similar way as the 1st round with introductions and then moving on to the questions.<p>Two questions were asked in this round too<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li><strong>It was a simple graph coloring based problem and I easily explained my approach and coded the solution.</strong><li><strong>Find the length of the longest path present in a graph.
