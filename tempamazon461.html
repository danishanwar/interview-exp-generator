There were 5 rounds \xe2\x80\x93 Aptitude test and 4 Technical rounds.<p>The aptitude test was an online test hosted in HackerEarth platform. It consisted of 20 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s of 1 mark each and two coding questions of 100 marks each. Total time was 90 minutes. The MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s were from subjects such as Data Structures, Networks, Operating systems and a few shell command questions. The HR said that there was a separate cutoff for the MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s. The two coding questions were<ol><li>Given a string, find the longest sub-string such that the sub-string has unique letters.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/length-of-the-longest-substring/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Given a matrix, find the sum of the sub-matrix between two given points.<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/submatrix-sum-queries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></li></li></ol><p>The results were announced the next day. There were 4 technical rounds:<p>All rounds had similar questions such as \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about Amazon\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy amazon\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you have something you want to ask me\xe2\x80\x9d , \xe2\x80\x9cStrengths and weaknesses\xe2\x80\x9d and few other HR questions. The main focus of each round were the problems. First we have to solve the problem and explain out idea to the interviewer, and he may suggest modifications and improvements. After that we have write the code for the same (on parer). While writing the code take care to not to make too many corrections, start writing the code only after getting a clear idea of what to write.<p><strong><br/>Round 1:</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Given a binary search tree, find the k th smallest element.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-k-th-smallest-element-in-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Given a matrix which is sorted both row wise and column wise, search for an element.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2:</strong><ol><li>Given a linked list, find and remove all the loops.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-loop-in-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Construct a minimum spanning tree from a given weighted graph. While solving this I made use of certain \xe2\x80\x9cset\xe2\x80\x9d functions. As I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know syntax of these operations in C++, wherever I had to make use of set functions I wrote a \xe2\x80\x9csudo\xe2\x80\x9d function call. So after writing the code for the question, she asked me to implement the set functions that I had used.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-spanning-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></li></li></ol><p><strong><br/>Round 3:</strong><br/>He didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me any problems. The questions were mostly based on an SQL based project that I had done, and on my internship.<br/><strong><br/>Round 4:</strong><ol><li>Given a number, find the next higher number which is a palindrome.<br/><blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong>: if given number is 99 next highest palindromic number is 101, if given number is 72 next highest palindromic number is 77.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-greater-even-number/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></p></li></ol><p>This article is contributed by <strong>Sooraj B Uday</strong>.
