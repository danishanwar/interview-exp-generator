It was open to CSE and ECE with a CGPA of 6.0 and above.<br/><strong>Round 1:</strong> It was an online round hosted on https://tests.mettl.com/ .There were 3 questions with a duration of 90 minutes and to qualify, one have to solve around 1 and half. But some get shortlisted even with only one correct submission. The questions were in the format like easy-easy-medium.Around 160 appeared for this round out of which around 40 were selected for next round.<br/>Tips- If you are regular at solving problems then this round is going to be a cakewalk for you. But try to have some hands on experience on above platform using the link given because questions are easy but the IDE/Platform makes them tough i.e in my case #include&amp;lt;bits/stdc++.h&amp;gt; wasn\xe2\x80\x99t working :(( and the IDE only supported C++ 5.4 and there was no C++ 11/14.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> It was a pen paper based round.This time they changed their pattern, There were 2 questions, one was based on sequence<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/look-and-say-sequence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/look-and-say-sequence/</a><br/>And the other was from system design.We have to design a search engine for a global retail application for which we have write 1.)Assumptions 2.)Design Considerations 3.)Design components<br/>14 students get qualified for next round.<br/>Tips- The code must be neat and clean with proper indentations for first question.<br/>For the designing they do not want any algorithm implementation like of Trie or something. They want students to think about the problems, solutions for the question and interact with the mentors around.Major criteria to qualify this round was System design question.<p>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> It was a face to face technical round. The interviewer first asked me a simple question from Linked List.I have given a node and has to return the address of it .List is not sorted.I shared linear search approach but he was not satisfied.Using binary search will cost more time, so he told me to use Hashmap.But still the time complexity remains the same.I think he want to check in how many ways I can think to solve.Then he asked me to explain my solution for the system design question in Round 2. I have explained my solution.Then he asked me what is Scalability, What is Horizontal scalability as I have mentioned Area of interest as Backend Development. Then he asked me the question <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/</a> .He asked me to code both the questions and also explain the solution for design question on paper.<br/>Out of 14, only 8 were qualified for the next round.<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> It was another face to face technical round. The interviewer in this round first asked me \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d.He asked me to explain my projects.The round started with questions like What is volatile int, difference in \xe2\x80\x9cmain()\xe2\x80\x9d function in C and C++ and how printf() function is compatible with dynamic arguments. Then he moved to coding questions https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/ . I told him all the approaches and he asked me to code them all. Later he told me to write edge cases for the above question.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Then he asked me the question https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/ . I told him all the approaches and code them on paper.He was quite helping and very satisfied with my answer.<p><strong>Round 5 (HR) :</strong> Around 7 students made it to this final round.It was around 21 min long.He first asked general questions about me, how I\xc2\xa0 computer industry is heading, what latest technology you have learned and what next you will learn.I told him about my interest in backend development and in future I will be learning NLP(Natural Language Processing).So he asked me real time use cases of NLP.Then he asked my solution for design problem in Round 2.He was digging my approach up to the limit.Then he asked some general HR questions.<p><strong>VERDICT:</strong> A total of 6 applicants made it to the final list and I was one of them !!!!!<p>Tips for F2F rounds : First of all, try to wear a smile on your face during the interviews.Be confident and think out loud. Believe me, most of the interviewers are way cool and supportive. They want you to crack their interviews and they are ready to help as much as possible.<p>Mention only the things, which you think, you are confident at.<p><strong>Considerations prior to D-Day :</strong> Try to have some internship/academic projects\xc2\xa0 (atleast one) in your Resume. Besides this practice questions on geeksforgeeks and interviewbit during the summers. Stay calm. Stay Chill. Avoid negative people and surrounding. Read past experiences at Geeksforgeeks, they literally helped a lot. Geeksforgeeks.
