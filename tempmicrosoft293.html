Node structure is : left, right, data, next. Each level next should point to the next right node in the level. For last node in each level, next should be NULL<ul><li>Then, the question was extended : Toggle the linking every K level. Means, you will be given a tree root node and a number K. For first K level, you should link to next right node. Next K you should link to next left and so on.</li></ul><li>Given a city containing n people, a mayor candidate is one who does not like anybody but everybody else likes him.
