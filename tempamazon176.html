In my case, I finished the test half an hour before the allotted time.<p><strong>Round 2 (Technical Interview 60 min): </strong>First, the interviewer asked to introduce myself. Then he asked about the projects I did. After an introductory discussion on projects, he gave me 2 coding questions on their personal live code environment.<p>He asked me to explain the approach first and then code it down. I had to explain the time complexity of each solution and optimal code if possible with lesser time complexity.<ol><li>Given an array, make in-place replacement such that every element is replaced by its greatest element in right.<li>An array with multiple characters(may have more than one occurrences) given with a value K. Makes the minimum number of replacements in the array such that in the resultant array we have only K distinct characters(This question was asked as a word problem with some given conditions.)</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3 (Technical Interview 120 min): </strong>Similar to the first round there was a brief introduction from both sides. This round was coding plus the kind of HR. After 2 coding questions, I was asked to describe a tough situation which I faced while completing any project of mine, what was my target, what I did to overcome it, and what was the end result.<ol><li>A sequence is given as [ T T T T B B B B B B B B B B \xc2\xa0B T T ] where T denoted the number of TVs bikes and B denoted Bajaj bikes. Write code to count the number of Bajaj bikes in the garage in the most optimal way.<p>I solved it in O(log n) using binary search.<p>The second question was typical to understand. And I initially thought that I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to solve it. But the interviewer was very friendly and cooperative. And he made me reach towards the answer with an optimized solution. I was asked to write a complete working function for this one.<li>You are given a bulk of data of 10Mbs and you have a 1Mb RAM available with you. How would you sort the complete 10 Mb of data using this RAM?<p>The first approach I explained it using merge sort. But it was not that optimized. I was also asked to explain the complexity of each function of the merge sort in every pass. This was something like merging N arrays.<p>At last, I gave a solution using heap with lesser time complexity, and the interviewer was satisfied by it in last.</p></p></li></p></p></li></ol><p>15 students were selected among 38 in the interview rounds and I was one of them.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
