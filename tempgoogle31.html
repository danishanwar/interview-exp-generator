If yes, then <strong>Google\xe2\x80\x99s Coding Competitions</strong> can help you. Google\xe2\x80\x99s Coding Competitions are designed by the engineers at Google and these coding challenges are conducted by the organization every year to assess the coders around the world. It is a great way to showcase your programming skills and problem-solving skills at the international level. This is great news for all the programming enthusiasts that this year also Google is going to conduct these competitions.<p><img alt="Google\xe2\x80\x99s-Coding-Competitions-You-Can-Consider-in-2021" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-547988" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20210125191729/Google%E2%80%99s-Coding-Competitions-You-Can-Consider-in-2021.png"/><p>The most popular among all competitions are <strong>Hash Code</strong>, <strong>Code Jam</strong>, and <strong>Kick Start</strong>. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at each of the competition in detail:<h3>1. Hash Code</h3><p>Hash Code is one of the most famous coding challenges organized by Google every year, for students and professionals. Owing to the current pandemic situation, Hash Code 2021 is going to be a virtual event. This is a team event where you have to make a small team of 2-4 coders from wherever you would like, along with your virtual hub. In this challenge, the team tries to solve a real Google engineering problem through an Online Qualification round. All the teams will compete together virtually in locally coordinated Hash Code Hubs and the top teams from this round will compete for the virtual World Finals. In the qualification round, each team gets four hours to provide an optimized solution to the problem using programming language and other tools of their choice. \xc2\xa0In the virtual World Finals, all the teams will code together to solve another challenge and compete for cash prizes. You can also see and practice the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s problem statements from the <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/archive" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official page</a>.<ul><li><i>Applications are open for Hash Code 2021; you can apply from </i><a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></li></ul><h3>2. Code Jam</h3><p>Code Jam is another famous coding challenge organized by Google every year. It is Google\xe2\x80\x99s longest global coding competition where coders from all over the world take part and test their coding skills. There are three online-hosted rounds before the Annual Code Jam World Finals which is held at an international Google office every year. In each round, the participants have to solve challenging algorithmic puzzles within a limited timeframe. In the end, only 25 participants will compete for cash prizes and the coveted championship title at the annual Code Jam World Finals. You can also see and try the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s problems from their <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/archive" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">archive page</a>.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li><i>Registration for Code Jam 2021 will start from Feb 17, 2021; you can apply from </i><a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></li></ul><h3>3. Kick Start</h3><p>Kick Start, formerly known as APAC is again one of Google\xe2\x80\x99s famous coding competitions held every year where coders around the world take part and get a chance to enhance their coding skills. There are online-hosted rounds held regularly throughout the year. Each round is open to all and there is no pre-qualification needed. So, you can participate in one or all of them. Each round is of three-hour which has a variety of algorithmic and mathematical problems. Taking part in anyone round gives a taste of the skill set required for a carrier at Google. After each round, you can check your global rankings and performance analysis of that particular round. You can also see the results and code of past Kick Start rounds and practice the problems from their <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/archive" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">archive page</a>.<ul><li><i>Registration for Kick Start 2021 will start from Feb 9, 2021; you can apply from </i><a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></li></ul><p>If you are at the beginner level in the world of programming or coding; Google Kick Start is the best option available to you. As mentioned above Google Kick Start consists of online coding challenges hosted throughout the year to help you in getting better acquainted with coding competitions and enhance your programming/coding skills.<h3 style="text-align:center">How to Prepare for these Google\xe2\x80\x99s Coding Challenges?</h3><p>Here are some preparation tips for you:<ul><li>Get yourself familiarized with the platforms by visiting the FAQ section for each challenge.<li>Choose at least one programming language like C++, Java, or Python and get familiarize with it.<li>Refresh your knowledge about fundamental algorithms and data structures like Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Lists, etc.<li>Must utilize the resources provided by Google to prepare for these competitions.<li>Do time-bound practice with the past year\xe2\x80\x99s problems.<li>The most important tip is to keep working on your testing skills like catching bugs, creating tests, building edge cases, etc.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>Hence, if you really wanted to get a flavor of the kinds of problems that engineers at Google have to deal with. You must try to participate in one or all of these coding challenges. All these three competitions organized by Google are equally important for participants of all skill levels. It is going to be a lifelong experience for you and you will learn a lot. If you are aspiring to get a job at Google, these coding challenges can help you in a great way.
