(I answered using file handling and indexing in a tree)\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">And a few follow-up questions on the above one(like more efficiency, ease of computation, different scenarios, time and space complexities.)\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Validating a string expression that may contain numbers, \xe2\x80\x98*\xe2\x80\x99 for multiplication, \xe2\x80\x98/\xe2\x80\x99 for division, \xe2\x80\x98+\xe2\x80\x99 for addition, \xe2\x80\x98-\xe2\x80\x99 for division, and some brackets. I came up with a stack approach. Then he asked me to code the same(need not run it). I have coded it, he was satisfied but just ran it to test and it was working fine, but failed for a corner case. He then asked me to debug. It took 2-3 mins but found the bug. I just changed the code and it worked well. However, it was not necessary to run the code. You can write the code in a text editor or doc file too\xc2\xa0</span></li></li></li></ul><p><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000"><strong><u>Second Technical Round: </u></strong>(for me it was technical+HR)\xc2\xa0</span><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">(started with an HR question) What did you learn in these 2 years of college?\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">How will you check whether a tree is balanced or not?\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">I know the concept but never coded it before. I told my approach, he was OK with that. And asked me to code. I did it but in a brute force manner. He asked me if it was the optimal way. Then I came up with a DP approach with O(n) time, O(n) space. He was more than satisfied when I applied dp in that question. However, the most optimal solution has O(n) time and O(1) space. He asked me to think of such a solution. I asked for a hint. Then I came up with the most optimal approach.</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Reason behind selection results<i>(Which skills helped you the most to get the job?)</i>: Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA), Competitive Programming(CP), Communication skills\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Preparation Strategy<i>(How did you prepare for the non-interview rounds? How did your preparation evolve for the interview rounds?)</i>:\xc2\xa0</span></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000"><strong><u>Coding Round:</u>\xc2\xa0</strong></span><ul><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">I did not prepare for the coding round separately because I regularly do Competitive Programming(CP) contests which have given me enough confidence for the coding round.\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Because of regularly doing Competitive Programming, I was good at debugging which helped me a lot in the coding round.\xc2\xa0</span></li></li></ul><p><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000"><strong><u>Technical Interviews:</u>\xc2\xa0</strong></span><ul><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">For the technical interviews, I have practiced (kind of revision at the same time) DSA questions from Leetcode and GfG for almost a month before the interview.\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">I have revised the whole Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) because some companies do ask questions on that. While preparing for the internship season, I did pair programming with a few of my friends which helped me learn faster and effectively.\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Even today I do pair programming most of the time instead of just practicing alone. Pair programming is very much useful and a very effective mode of coding. I learned a few topics including Dynamic Programming(DP) just 1 month before the interview. Since I had less time, whatever the DP question I solved, I did it in both ways(i.e. top-down and bottom-up). This helped me to become good at it in less time.\xc2\xa0</span></li></li></li></ul><p><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000"><strong><u>HR Round:</u> </strong>Coming to HR round. I have watched some mock interviews available on youtube which gave me an idea about the HR round. I was prepared to be confident and speak in a structured manner. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go through the HR round. I got selected after 2nd technical interview itself.\xc2\xa0</span><ul><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">However, my interviewer asked 1 or 2 HR questions.\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">He asked me \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you learn in these 2 years of college?\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">I was also well prepared for HR questions like \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we hire you?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are your Strengths and Weaknesses?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to join our company?\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">I have made a portfolio website and 2 ML projects.\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Resources to prepare from \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Necessary Resources<i>(Must Do)</i>:\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Leetcode and GFG(for DSA),\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Javatpoint.com(for OOPs),\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Advanced Resources<i>(Can Do)</i>: Codeforces,</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Internship Experience<i>(If Completed)</i>:\xc2\xa0</span></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Anything else that you\xe2\x80\x99d like to share with the students: Focus on DSA and your communication skills. some companies also ask OOPs questions. Consistency matters the most while learning anything. Pair programming is very much effective. Competitive Programming helps a lot in coding rounds, DSA, pressure handling, Problem Solving, and debugging.\xc2\xa0</span><p><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Other Suggestions:\xc2\xa0</span><ol><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Communicate well with the interviewer\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Be confident\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Proper planning and dedication is helpful in cracking any company\xc2\xa0</span><li><span style="background-color:initial;color:#000">Don\xe2\x80\x99t neglect CGPA and Sem exams. Many good students are not able to apply for many companies due to a CGPA cut-off(on-campus internships). Try to have a CGPA above 8.\xc2\xa0</span></li></li></li></li></ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
