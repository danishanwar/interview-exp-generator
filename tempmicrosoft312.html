Fairly simple. I suggested some approaches and i was expected to come out with the best approach.<br/>then i was asked to code my solution and design the test cases for the same.<li>I was asked about my favorite subject.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/">Write and explain the code to connect nodes at same level in a binary tree</a>.<p>Soon after the fourth round some of us were called for the next round.<p><strong>Round 5 (Technical) (30 mins)</strong><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-get-the-intersection-point-of-two-linked-lists/">Given a Y- linked list.

Find the number of occurrences of each character.</a><br/>The question was further modified to include the special characters as well. I was asked to design the test cases for the same.<li>Remove duplicate characters from a given string keeping only the first occurrences (i.e order should not change).
