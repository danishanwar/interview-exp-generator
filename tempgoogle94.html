We at <a href="https://www.toptalent.in/" target="_blank">TopTalent.in</a> spoke to Krunal about the Google Interview Process, how he managed to crack it and what are his suggestions for aspirants looking to achieve something similar.<p>You can also <a href="https://www.toptalent.in/jobseeker-registration.php" target="_blank">download</a> his resume by logging in to your account.<p><strong>TopTalent: Can you tell us about the interview process?</strong><p>Google conducted APAC test for 2015 graduating students in Asia pacific regions. I was 8th overall and 2nd in India after Divanshu. I was called for interviews at Google Bangalore office after that. I had 4 interviews in total and all of them were based on data structures and algorithms. A few basic questions were also asked from OS.<p><strong>TopTalent: Can you give us a brief account of what you felt was the toughest interview?</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>According to me all the interviews were of similar difficulty level. They were testing different domains in Algorithms and Data structures. The last interview was relatively at a bit higher difficulty level.<p><strong>TopTalent: What was your preparation strategy?</strong><p>I revised all my computer science CDCs before the placement season started. Lecture slides were good enough for that. I prepared for the GATE exam in the beginning of the year and it saved a lot of time for me during placement season. In my last 4 years my goal was to learn as many new technologies as possible. I gained introductory knowledge in web designing, Machine learning, Network Science, Application development etc. Apart from that I regularly practiced on codechef and topcoder to improve my programming and problem solving skills. I also thoroughly revised my projects which were mentioned in my resume before the interviews.<p><strong>TopTalent: What kind of skills do you think helped you getting this job?</strong><p>Mainly programming skills. I like participating in various programming contest and it improved my knowledge in algorithms as well as my programming skills. For eg. I learned to spend more time in designing the solution than in coding. Special thanks to my friend N Hari Prasad (Google Hyd) who guided me all the time.<p><strong>TopTalent: What resources did you consult? Where did you practice problems from?</strong><p>For my computer science subjects I mainly used my textbooks and lecture slides. For Algorithms I used Cormen and various tutorials on internet.<p><strong>TopTalent: How was Competitive Programming in the interview?</strong><p>By participating in such competitions and practicing in topcoder, I improved in terms of speed , Accuracy , Efficiency , and problem solving approaches. All of them plays crucial role in interviews where we are asked to design and code the solution for an unseen problem<p><strong>TopTalent: Were grades a factor in you getting selected?</strong><p>Google asked for my grade sheet after all the interviews were over. Hence it was part of their review process. Good grades always make a better impression.<p><strong>TopTalent: What\xe2\x80\x99s your advice to students who are aiming for similar placement offers as yours?</strong><p>1) Writing code after you solve a question or learn a new data structure or algorithm is equally important. Make a habit to write neat and readable code as that helps your entire team. Make sure you get your code reviewed. In case of programming puzzles, see the setter\xe2\x80\x99s solution.<p>2) Attend your classes regularly.<p>3) Find your passion and never give up on it. Rest all follows.<p>4) Keep yourself updated with new technologies.<p>In case you missed, you can also <a href="https://www.toptalent.in/jobseeker-registration.php" target="_blank">download</a> his resume by logging in to your account.<p><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px">This article is powered by </span><strong style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px"><a href="http://toptalent.in/" target="_blank">TopTalent.in</a> </strong><span style="font-size:13px;line-height:19px">\xe2\x80\x93 A high end Job portal for students and alumni of Premier Colleges in India.
