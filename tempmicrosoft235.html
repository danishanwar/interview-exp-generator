If does not exist, return NULL.<p>Q3) complete the following function:<pre>\r\nNode * findIntersection( Node* head1, Node*head2){\r\n   // code goes here\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhere node is the structure of a linked list node\r\ndefined as:\r\n\r\nstruct Node{\r\n  int data;\r\n  Node *next;\r\n}; </pre><p>Return the head pointer to the intersection of the two linked lists. It was mentioned that no extra space to be used and implementation should be recursive.<p><strong><br/>GROUP FLY ROUND:</strong><p>40 candidates were shortlisted for the group fly round.<p>The candidates were roughly divided in a group of 4-5 and a mentor was in charge of each group. We were given a question and we were asked to write a function-solution in any high level language (scripting languages like Ruby, php, python were not allowed). We were allotted maximum 45 minutes.<p>Ques: Given two character arrays(not strings) of same length, and their length as a parameter to the function. We have to find whether the first string is a rotation of the other. We should not use any extra space. The time complexity may be quadratic.<p>The mentor kept coming to everyone. He first asked what i was thinking. I told him the approach with an example. Then I wrote the code, sample test cases and a basic approach section in bullets. Though, they demanded only the code.<p><strong>ROUND 1:</strong><p>Around 50% candidates were selected after the group fly round.<p>I was given two coding questions:<p>Ques 1) given a tree, print all the edges of the tree such that both the following conditions are satisfied:<br/>Only print the node whose right child is NULL,<br/>The node is a leaf node.<p>I gave a recursive approach. I later realised while explaining that it failed in certain conditions. I asked for some time to rectify it. I finally gave him a code and he seemed fine about it.<p>Ques 2) given a matrix, traverse the matrix in a zig-zag manner:<pre>\r\n    Ex:  \r\n        1 2 3 4\r\n        5 6 7 8\r\n        9 1 1 2\r\n\r\nTraversal: 1 2 5 9 6 3 4 7 1 1 8 2</pre><p>I gave an approach of time complexity O(N X M). He asked me if i can do it in lesser time complexity. I may use extra space. I could not come up with anything very concrete. My round was done.<p><strong>ROUND 2:</strong><br/>The interviewer asked how was my group fly round. Then he explained to me a situation that I have a fixed 2-D space of NXM. I have been given a set of random numbers(not in running). I have to find an efficient way to store them and such that I can retrieve each element in least time complexity.<p>With hit and trials we reached an approach where I can store the numbers in such a way that each row is sorted, and the order across the rows is also increasing. Now we can just apply binary search on 1st column to find the appropriate row , and then binary search the number in the obtained row. Time complexity: logM+logN. He asked me to code it. That was it for the second round.<p>The interviewer was very helpful and jolly.<p><strong><br/>ROUND 3: (FINAL)</strong><br/>I was called for round 3 after 15 minutes. It was supposed to be HR but it was predominantly technical. I was asked about all my projects and my role in them.<p>Then he gave me a question and said that we would discuss only the approach ,and there was no need to code it.<p>The problem was similar to the below geeksforgeeks problem:<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer-set-7-the-skyline-problem/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer-set-7-the-skyline-problem/</a><p>I struggled a bit but he helped me. Then we discussed the final solution and approach.<br/>Since it was 8:30 pm, I was done for the day. After the round was over, I was told that I am done with all the rounds and need not come the other day.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using <a href="http://www.contribute.geeksforgeeks.org">contribute.geeksforgeeks.org</a> or mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
