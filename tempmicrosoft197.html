The process took around 2 weeks. I was interviewed at Microsoft (Bangalore) in November 2017.<p>Mainly they wanted developers for redesigning their product outlook.com in ReactJs.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/microsoft-launches-a-faster-smarter-outlook-com-into-public-beta/">News</a><p>Initially, I got a mail from HR and I replied back stating my availability. Later I had a talk with HR and scheduled for a telephonic interview.<p><strong>Round 1(Telephonic):\xc2\xa0</strong><p>The interview started with my CV. He asked me about my work and responsibility at my current office. Then started with some questions which I was asked to code in plain javascript.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Reverse String in-place\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/">Link</a><li>Flattening an array. Ex: Input : [[1, 2, 3], 4, [5, [6, 7]] Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. I gave a recursive solution.<li>Designing an\xc2\xa0image carousel.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp">Link</a></li></li></li></ol><p>I answered all of them, and then he said that interview is over. And I will be contacted further if selected. (I was surprised since I expected some more questions). Then just after around half an hour, I got a call from the HR, and she said that they\xc2\xa0want to continue with further rounds, and asked for my availability.<p><strong>Round 2(Onsite at Bangalore):\xc2\xa0</strong><p>There were around 15 other candidates for this round. They handed us a sheet and asked to\xc2\xa0write two codes in 1hr.<p>1. Expression Evaluation.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expression-evaluation/">Link</a><p>2. Write a code in HTML, CSS, JS to form two list selection. And the user can perform several operations on these like:<p><strong>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 &gt;&gt; &amp; &lt;&lt;</strong>(Move all from List1 A to List B ).<p><strong>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 &gt; &amp; &lt;</strong> (Move only selected items)<p>Up, Down to select the item<p>Also an Text Area and Add button below List A, to add rows to the list.<p>Writing these codes on paper was messy and I never expected this from Microsoft. Anyways around 10 people got selected for\xc2\xa0the next round.<p><strong><br/>Round 3(PI):\xc2\xa0</strong><p>I was a bit nervous\xc2\xa0and the interviewer asked me to calm relax and asked for my experience with javascript. Then she asked me (rather discussed) on how to make a UI design for the snake-ladder problem. We had a discussion after which she asked me to write a code to insert the numbers(1-100) spirally(as in the snake ladder game). I coded it and eventually round 3 was over.<p><strong>Round 4(PI):\xc2\xa0</strong><p>He went through my CV and asked a question related to ECM(which I have been working on at my office). Then he asked me to write a code for reversing a Linked List.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/">Link</a>\xc2\xa0. He seemed\xc2\xa0fine with the code and asked me to wait outside.<p>I was happy till then. Had a sumptuous lunch at the MS office.But then HR called me up after sometime and said they can\xe2\x80\x99t continue any further.I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact reason for the rejection but had a great experience to interview with Microsoft.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
