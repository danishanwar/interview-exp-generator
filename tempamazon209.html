It is to promote women in technology. It is a very good opportunity for women as they have to only compete with other females, not with males. The online application came in April. The program consists of a two-month internship for prefinal year student and fulltime plus Internship for final year student.<p>It consisted of a total 4 rounds, first was an online coding contest and then 3 telephonic interviews.<p><strong>Online test :\xc2\xa0</strong><p>The first round was an online coding round. It consisted of 2 coding questions and 28 MCQ. We had 1.2 hrs. The coding questions were quite simple but MCQs were very difficult. I would like to say that luck matters a lot in cracking online coding round.<p><strong>1. First question:</strong> Find the longest common subsequence between two string. It is standard Dynamic programming question but the constraints were not very high so I solved it using recursion.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>2. Second question: </strong>I did not find the exact question on any platform but it was very simple. You are given a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets, return the internet resource address of the string.<p>Internet resource address of a string is defined as<p>&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;domain&gt;.ru[/&lt;context&gt;]<p>&lt;protocol&gt; can be either http or ftp.<p>&lt;domain&gt;is a string consisting of lower case English alphabtes.<p>&lt;context&gt; is a non mepty string of lower case English alphabtes.<p>Ex\xc2\xa0: httpsunrux -&gt; http://sun.ru/x<p>For MCQs, you must have a strong grip on OOP and c++ language.<strong>:</strong><p><strong>Round 1:\xc2\xa0</strong><p>For this round, I was given an amazon chime link and live code editor link in which I had to code. The interviewer started by asking me my introduction and then he gave his introduction. In my introduction, I told him about my passion for competitive coding, writing and reading.<p>Then Immediately we moved to coding questions. He told me that I have only 45 minutes to answer so I have to come up with the best approach possible.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-an-iterative-olog-y-function-for-powx-y/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>1. First Question:</strong></a><strong>\xc2\xa0</strong> Find x ^ y mod z. I gave him the O(log(y)) approach. I covered all the edge cases when x will be zero or negative when y will be zero or negative. When y will be negative, he told me to return an error to the user. I coded properly using indentation and suitable variable and function names. I used int to store the variable but when the value is very high I should use long long int. I missed this case. He then moved to the second question.<p><strong>2. Second Question:</strong> \xc2\xa0Given a set of dependencies I have to find one of the suitable ordering of the dependencies. I told him I will use topological sort for this. He told me to explain my approach and then I coded it. But while coding I missed an edge case when there will cycle in the dependency. He told me to correct my code. I corrected my code by checking if there is a cycle present in the dependency.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-of-occurrences-or-frequency-in-a-sorted-array/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>3. Third Question:</strong></a> \xc2\xa0For this question, I gave him two-approaches, first one was linearly counting the no of x and second was using a modified binary search. He did not ask me to code this question.<p>The best part was that I had already solved all these questions before so I did not get nervous there. In the end, I asked him where I can improve, He told me to check code before finally submitting to the interviewer.<p>After 12 days the result of this round was declared.<p><strong>Round 2:\xc2\xa0</strong><p>For this round also, I was provided with the Amazon chime link and live code link. The interviewer asked me two questions.<p><strong>1.</strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-greater-values-every-node-given-bst/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong> First Question:</strong>\xc2\xa0</a> Add all greater values to every node in a given BST. I gave him O(n ) time complexity solution. Initially, I had written the wrong code but my approach was right. He dry ran my code, pointed out the mistake that I made in code and told me to correct the code. I corrected the code and he was satisfied by my approach. I told him about the time complexity ie O(n). I told him if we consider internal stack then space complexity will o(n) because in the worst case the height of BST can be O(n) if it is skewed BST.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-linked-list-already-sorted-absolute-values/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>2. Second Question:\xc2\xa0</strong></a> But in this question, He gave me three conditions.<p>1. You can traverse the data structure in only one direction.<p>2. You cannot use extra space ie in-place algorithm.<p>3. You can use any data structure of your choice.<p>My first approach was to use an array data structure. I told him that in first traversal I will find the count of negative numbers and then I will start filling my result array. But he said I cannot use extra space.<p>My second approach was to use a binary search tree and the result will be inorder traversal of the tree. But he told me that I have to return the data structure which I am using.<p>Then He asked me what are the data structure that I know. I told him I know heap, queue, stack, singly-Linked list and doubly linked list. Then suddenly doubly-linkedList came to my mind and I told him I will use doubly LinkedList. He told me that in doubly-linked you can traverse in both directions. Then I told him that will use a singly linked list. He told me to write code and dry ran my code. He was satisfied with my code.<p>My second interviewer was a very helpful and knowledgeable person. In the end, he said \xe2\x80\x9cit was nice to interview you. \xe2\x80\x9d<p>After 11 days the second-round result was declared.<p><strong>Round 3:\xc2\xa0</strong><p>For this round also, I was provided with the amazon chime link and live code link. The interviewer was a very nice and chill person. He tried to make me comfortable. He introduced himself and then I gave my brief introduction. In this round, I was asked two questions. One was a coding question and the other was OS( operating System ) question.<p><strong>1. First question:</strong> \xc2\xa0If we have a well-optimised code, On what factors the maximum no of threads in a process depends?<p>We had around half an hour discussion on this topic. I told him how threads are used in the client-server application, use of threads in a text editor which simultaneously performs writing, auto-correction and suggestions. He asked me if a site has 1 million clients, then 1 million threads will be created, I told him about the use of multiple servers. I told him the no. thread depends upon the resources of the machine. I told him it will depend upon the memory of the computer. Then He wanted to know, which memory affect it, primary memory or secondary memory. I told primary memory will affect the no of threads as all the processes/ threads reside in the primary memory. I was thinking of other factors also but then he moved to coding question.<p>After this, we moved to coding question.<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-smallest-positive-number-missing-from-an-unsorted-array/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>2. Second Question:\xc2\xa0</strong></a> \xc2\xa0Find the first missing positive number in an array.<p>My first approach was to use hashing, the time complexity of this approach was O(n ) and the space complexity was O(n). He told me to do it in constant space. I suggested to him that whenever I will encounter an element and if it is smaller than n, then I will make element negative at that index. Then I will traverse the whole array again and if I find any index whose value is non-negative, its means that element is not present and it is the first missing positive no. If no such no. is found then the answer will be n ( size of the array ) + 1. But this approach will not work for an array containing negative and repetitive no. So I improved my code to handle the negative and repetitive no.<p>He was very much satisfied with my approach. In the end, he asked me to ask a question to him. I asked him how can I improve more. He seemed to be very much impressed by me. He told me that I am very sharp in handling all the edges cases and I am very focussed.<p>Result: <strong>SELECTED</strong><p><strong>Some important tips:\xc2\xa0</strong><p>1. Always believe in your self.<p>2. Communication skills matter a lot in the interview.<p>3. Luck is an important factor, you can not ignore it.<p>4. Always be positive in life. No matter how difficult the situation do not give up.<p>5. Practise and patient is the key.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
