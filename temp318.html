Level of coding questions varies from easy to medium. Everyone had different coding questions. Few which I remember are:<p>1. Inversion count in the array<p>2. Postfix evaluation\xc2\xa0(handle negative number also)<p>3. Mean median mode in array<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>4. Dice throw puzzle(DP)<p>5.Roots of quadratic equation<p>6.Linear equation in one variable<p>7.Longest common subsequence<p>8.Evaluate Infix operation (handle negative number also)<p>MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s were difficult and required deep knowledge of DSA and C C++.<p>Out of around 350 students 53 were called for interview.<p>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 1:</strong><p>Interview lasted for 25 minutes and had a detailed discussion on 2 questions. He directly started with a coding question.<ol><li>given a string encode it. Eg. aaabb -&gt; a3b2<li>there are n person with their height and weight given. You have to select maximum number of person that can stand in a queue with condition that height and weight of person in queue will always be less or equal to next person.you have to return persons not the count. (LIS)</li></li></ol><p>This round went well and I was immediately called for next round.<p><strong>Round 2:\xc2\xa0</strong><p>This round lasted for 30 minutes.<ol><li>Given k arrays of size n each. You have to select one number from each of them such that the difference between them is minimum. Initially, the question was for 3 arrays, I told him the solution quickly then he changed 3 to k.<li>Implent AVL.<li>a question on designing a data structure I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember. I used hash for that. He asked me about hash worst time complexity, ideas to improve it.<li>A question on trie.<li>median of running stream of integers.<li>Given an array of n integers ranging from 1-n-2, in which every integer comes once and two integer comes twice, find both of them.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>I had to write code for every question. This interview also went well and I was called for next round immediately.<p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>This round went for 90minutes. This was different from previous two. It was more of a discussion round.<ol><li>Project discussion.<li>Range Sum query with update. I told him prefix sum. He wanted better approach. I told him segment tree.<li>He then asked range update in best optimised way. I told him Lazy propogation.\xc2\xa0 I had to write code for segment tree with lazy propogation.<li>1 hour discussion on networks. (I told him I haven\xe2\x80\x99t revised but he kept on asking)</li></li></li></li></ol><p>This round also went well. In networks he provided some input whenever I needed. Since it was late my next round was scheduled next day.<p><strong>Round 4(Bar raiser)</strong><p>This round went for approx 1 hour.<ol><li>Wildcard Pattern Matching. I discussed all corner cases and base cases along with recurrence relation. He asked me to write code in bottom up dp. He was really happy with my solution.<li>\xc2\xa0Design a data structure for running stream of string. You have to print a word if it has not come within 10 second else ignore it. You have to manage memory in most optimal way. I discussed the various approach using trie, hash, lru. When I told him my solution with queue and hash, He was surprised an told me that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that solution. He asked me to code it.<li>project discussion.<li>oops- How abstract class is implemented by compiler. When I told him the solution he said awesome.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>I was sure of my selection as I had seen my remarks sheet and all my remarks were strength except for cs fundamental in 3rd round which was mixed, and also 4th round was good.<p>Result announced at 12:30 a.m. total 9 got selected for FTE and I was one of them.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
