MCQs had negative marking +1 and -0.25. there was no detection of points for wrong submission in coding questions.<p>From my college 13, students were selected for 2nd round, and in total 70 students from my city.they did not reveal any cut off criteria but student who solved atleast 1 coding question completely and atleast 8 to 10 (just an assumption) mcq\xe2\x80\x99s correctly were selected for next round.<p><strong>Round 1</strong>: This was face to face technical interview coducted for all the colleges together. they gave 2 questions and we were asked to write the entire working code and to optimize the solution, the interviewers were friendly and helped us if we got stuck anywhere.after this round 30 students were selected for next round out of 70.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1">Convert a tree into it\xe2\x80\x99s mirror tree</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-a-binary-tree-in-vertical-order/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print a binary tree in vertical order</a></li></li></ol><p>this round took around 1 hr 15 min.<p><strong>Round 2 </strong>: This round was also a face to face technical interview.the interviewer asked me to introduce myself while he was entering some details in his lappy.then he asked me who took my 1st round. i din knew the name of my 1st round interviewer.he was smiling and said \xe2\x80\x9crelax, i was just casually asking\xe2\x80\x9d. i was given 2 coding question. for the 1st question he just asked to explain the approach and optimize it and for the 2nd question he asked to write the entire working code and explain it.this round took around 45 min.<ol><li>Given an array we have to find the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-mean-and-median-of-an-unsorted-array/">median of the array when it is sorted but we should not sort it</a>.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-sum-without-adjacents/0">Find Maximum possible stolen value from houses.</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3:</strong> This round was conducted only for those students for whom they were doubtful. fortunately i was selected in 2nd round itself.<p>Interviewers were friendly. They helped us giving hints wherever we got stuck.<p>My advice is be confident. don\xe2\x80\x99t give up, if you are stuck anywhere. Tell them atleast a brute force approach and they will give you hints to optimize it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be scared, practice questions from geeksforgeeks, almost all of them were asked from geeksforgeeks collection.<p>Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
