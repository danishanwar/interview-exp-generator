Rules for traversing:<br/>1. You can only change one character at a time<br/>2. Any resulting word has to be a valid word from dictionary<br/>Example: Given source word CAT and destination word DOG , one of the valid sequence would be<br/>CAT -&gt; COT -&gt; DOT -&gt; DOG<br/>Another valid sequence can be<br/>CAT -&gt; COT \xe2\x80\x93 &gt; COG -&gt; DOG<p>One character can change at one time and every resulting word has be a valid word from dictionary<br/>I told him a approach using graph.<p>2) What is hashing.<p>3) What is modular hashing.<p>4) How collisions can be handled.<p>5) Is semphore guarantee deadlock prevention.<p><strong>*** Fourth Round (F2F) : (2 hr)</strong><p>1)<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/the-celebrity-problem/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> A kind of celebrity problem you have n person where one of them is celebrity</a><br/>condition are all non-celeb person knows celebrity and celebrity can know few other persons and all non- celeb persons can know few of them among each other so you have to find celebrity.<p>2)<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/min-distance-between-two-given-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given a binary tree and two nodes print the path between the two nodes of binary tree.</a><p>3) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-parent-array/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find Height of Binary Tree represented by Parent array</a><p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
