The test was conducted on mettl platform. Everyone had different set of questions . Some of the questions were :<ol><li>LCS<li>Some String implementation question<li>Dice Throw Problem<li>Roots of quadratic equation.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>After this round, 30 were shortlisted for\xc2\xa0 further rounds.<p><strong>Round 1 (Technical Round) :\xc2\xa0</strong>The first 15-20 minutes were spent on project discussion, some cases to solve\xc2\xa0 and use of process synchronization. Then the interviewer asked 2 coding questions :<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-distance-k-given-node-binary-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-distance-k-given-node-binary-tree/</a><li>\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-to-check-if-a-singly-linked-list-is-palindrome/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-to-check-if-a-singly-linked-list-is-palindrome/</a></li></li></ol><p>Initially, they want to know about the approach, if satisfied, they ask to write full functional code on paper . In between, they asked about the complexity of algorithm and more optimization that could be done on it.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2 (Technical Round):</strong>\xc2\xa0The interviewer gave 2 coding questions :<ol><li>Find the LCA (Least Common ancestor) of nodes having maximum depth in a given rooted tree . He asked about the approach, complexity and data structure to use . In between, he asked some common questions like time and space complexity of dfs, bfs, dijkstra (in terms of E and V ) .<li>\xc2\xa0In the last 15 min, he asked me to implement queue using two stacks.</li></li></ol><p>He asked me to code both questions on paper . Take care of corner cases like skew tree, empty stack, etc .<p>After this round, 12 of us were given 6 month internships . 3 of us were shortlisted for further rounds .<p><strong>Round 3 (Technical Round) :</strong> The interviewer asked me 3 coding questions :<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perfect-sum-problem-print-subsets-given-sum/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perfect-sum-problem-print-subsets-given-sum/</a><li>Given a list of string\xc2\xa0 and a prefix . He asked to print all the strings in the list\xc2\xa0 having that prefix . He asked what data structure to use, time and space complexity of it . He basically wanted to see\xc2\xa0 implementation of operations on trie\xc2\xa0 .<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-array-number-x-find-pair-array-whose-sum-closest-x/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-array-number-x-find-pair-array-whose-sum-closest-x/</a></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4 (<b>Behavioral\xc2\xa0</b>+ Technical ) :\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</strong>This round was taken on amazon chime . This round was of 1 hour .<p>Behavioral (30 min):<ul><li>\xc2\xa0 Give an example of an occasion where you\xe2\x80\x99ve done a thing that was very hard for you .<li>\xc2\xa0 How did you handle shortcomings in your project .<li>\xc2\xa0 Compare your project with the current existing technology or project in real world scenario .<li>\xc2\xa0 He asked questions related to my project like why did you chose this technology, alternatives of the technology, difference between vertical and horizontal scaling, etc .</li></li></li></li></ul><p>Technical ( 30 min ) :<ul><li>Given a package and a list of packages associated with it (Means the package is dependent on those list of packages ) . Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re given a package name, let\xe2\x80\x99s say A, print all the packages in sequence that you need to install in order to install package A .\xc2\xa0 This was basically an implementation of Topological Sort . He was more interested in the approach and then asked me to code it up on editor .</li></ul><p>Result : Selected for FTE \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
