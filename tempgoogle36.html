There were 2 questions in the assessment. Both of them were from Binary Trees. Getting a test link doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sure that your resume is shortlisted. Also, a test is held so that your resume can get into the Recruiter\xe2\x80\x99s hand because there are tons of students who have applied for the same role.\xc2\xa0<p>So, after a week I got an email from a Google recruiter asking for the interview availability. There were 2 interview rounds of 45 minutes each on the same day with a gap of 15 minutes. In the first interview, he asked me about my projects and then codding questions related to my project. The question was based on N-Ary Trees. If you are having projects then make sure you have in and out knowledge of every concept related to it then I was left with around 15 minutes after the code, and then he asked me a follow-up question, and then he asked me to ask questions if I was having any. Then the second interview started, and he asked me to introduce myself, and then he asked me a Dynamic Programming question. It was Leetcode Hard. I wasted a lot of time doing that question and after 3 days I got a mail that they have moved with another candidate. \xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
