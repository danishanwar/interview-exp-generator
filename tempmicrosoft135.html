Minimum CGPA was 7 and no backlogs were allowed.<p><strong>Coding Round( ONLINE )</strong><p>It was an online coding test which had three questions and 90 mins were allotted for it. Different people got different sets of questions.<p>1) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-total-number-of-distinct-years-from-a-string/<p>2) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-odd-and-even-values-in-alternate-fashion-in-ascending-order/<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>3) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52775518/number-of-buses-originating-from-a-bus-stop-a-computer-program<p>I solved all the 3 problems. The result was announced after 20 days and I was qualified. After some days I got my interview details.<p><strong>Round 0(FLY ROUND):\xc2\xa0</strong><p>This was a pen-paper based round and in this round almost 160 students participated from different institutes of India. 2 questions were asked and they gave us 60 minutes to solve. The problems were :-<p>1)https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-linked-list-with-next-and-arbit-pointer/<p>2)https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-alternate-levels-binary-tree/<p>Only 20 students were selected for the next round. I was one among them.<p>Note:- If you have enough time left then write comments and explain your approach . Also variable names should be self explanatory for better understanding.<p><strong>Round 1(Technical):\xc2\xa0</strong><p>It was a f2f interview and the interviewer was very nice and friendly.\xc2\xa0 First he brought my fly round paper and asked how can I improve my solutions. Then he asked me these problems:-<p>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expression-evaluation/<p>https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-print-substrings-given-string/<p>As a modification to the second problem he asked me how will I find the longest repeated sub-string within the same string in which the characters can overlap.<p>After that he asked me:- Given two tables A and B ( in SQL ) how can I print only those rows which are present in A and not in B without using multiple select statement ( Note that due to this restriction we cannot use the MINUS operator ). I gave him a solution which uses JOIN function in SQL but it was incomplete. After his help I was able to solve it completely. Then he asked me a question in Computer Networks and i told him that I am not good in this topic and he moved on . He then asked me whether I have any questions for him. I asked 2-3 questions and then the interview came to an end.<p>I was waiting outside when I was informed about the whereabouts of my 2nd interview.<p><strong>Round 2(Technical):</strong><p>The interviewer first asked me about my college which was followed by 1-2 minute of general talks. After that he gave me a question and asked me to write the code.The question was:-<p>Given n locations/directories of a file print the directory in the order such that the parent directory comes before the child directory. For example a directory is \xe2\x80\x9ca/\xe2\x80\x9d and the second directory is \xe2\x80\x9ca/b/c/\xe2\x80\x9d so \xe2\x80\x9ca/\xe2\x80\x9d is the parent directory of \xe2\x80\x9ca/b/c\xe2\x80\x9d because to reach \xe2\x80\x9ca/b/c\xe2\x80\x9d we first need to reach \xe2\x80\x9ca/\xe2\x80\x9d.<p>Example:-<p>Input :- 1) a/<p>2) a/b/c<p>3) d/<p>4) d/e<p>Output :-<p>The input is already given in the sorted format and can be printed as it is. One more solution can be :-<p>1) a/<p>2) d/<p>3) a/b/c<p>4)d/e<p>I told him 3-4 approaches each time with a complexity less than the previous one. But he wanted a better solution. I finally arrived at a solution that we can just sort the strings according to their lengths and he was satisfied. He then told me to write radix sort for the same.<p>Although I was not confident in implementing radix sort but I tried and after taking some time I finally wrote the code. I explained my approach to him and then he told me to wait outside.<p>I was very nervous after this interview as I was not sure about my implementation of radix sort. But after some time I was called for the next round.<p><strong>Round 3(HR) :</strong><p>First he asked me to introduce myself and how were my previous interviews.The interviewer was polite. He asked me what i generally do to pass my time. Then he asked me my favorite topic in programming. I told him data structure. He asked what in data structure. I told him trees and graphs. He then asked me how will I explain to someone what is a tree who knows nothing about coding. Following that he asked me some applications of graphs. I told him maps, but he wanted another solution. He asked me how do you think Facebook works. I told him the connections between the friends is a generalization of graph data structure. Then more questions about implementation of mutual friends in Facebook followed. The interview came to an end and he asked me whether i have any questions for him. I asked him a\xc2\xa0 few questions.<p>After some time the HR came and asked for my resume and told me that they will get in touch with me within a few days to tell me whether I was selected or not.<p>After almost 30 days I got a mail from them stating that I was selected.
