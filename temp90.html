Today I\xe2\x80\x99m going to share my amazon interview experience for the role of SDE-1. Hope it\xe2\x80\x99ll help you in preparing for your next coding interview. \xc2\xa0So without further ado let\xe2\x80\x99s get started.\xc2\xa0<p>I applied for the role of SDE-1 through amazon jobs portal. Next I got an invite for Online Assessment (OA).<p><strong>Online Assessment: </strong>There are two parts of online assessment.<p>First part consisted of couple of questions based on data structures &amp; algorithms\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>First question \xe2\x80\x93 https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/<li>Second question \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/preview-problems/701942">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/preview-problems/701942</a></li></li></ol><p>Second part consisted mainly on behavioral aspects.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 1: </strong>This round was mostly a discussion on previous company project that I worked on, some behavioral questions based on Amazon leadership principles, some technical questions.\xc2\xa0<p>Some of the questions that I could recall are as follows :-<ul><li>Difference between process &amp; thread?<li>What are deadlocks and what are the necessary conditions for deadlocks to happen?<li>Some real life applications of thread &amp; process<li>Tell me about a time when the requirement was not clear to you? What you did and what was the final outcome?<li>Let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss about a complex project that you worked on. What was the final outcome and what you learned? There were some follow up questions on web sockets based on my answer.<li>Difference between synchronous I/O and asynchronous I/O?<li>Some questions based on Node JS non blocking I/O</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 2: </strong>This round was mixture of coding questions and behavioral questions.<ol><li>The behavioral question was: Have you experienced pressure at work? Describe such situation<li>Lowest common ancestor in binary tree and then lowest common ancestor in binary search tree.<p>https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problem-page.php?pid=700236<p>https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problem-page.php?pid=700221<p>We discussed on edge cases like<ul><li>What if the input node values are not present in the tree<li>one of the input node or both are null<li>root node is null</li></li></li></ul><li>Shortest unique prefix of all words in an array<p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problem-page.php?pid=706447">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problem-page.php?pid=706447/</a><p>we discussed on edge cases like:<ul><li>If input array is empty<li>If any word is empty<li>what if there are duplicate words in the input array ( the interviewer told that all words are distinct )</li></li></li></ul></p></p></li></p></p></p></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3: </strong>This round was mixture of coding questions and behavioral questions.<ol><li>The behavioral question was: Tell us about a time when you missed a deadline or productivity target? What was the business impact and what you learned from it?<li>Given an increasing series first and then decreasing find the first element which starts decreasing<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s say there\xe2\x80\x99s an array [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 10, 5, 1] -&gt; answer is 40 since from 40 it starts decreasing<p>We discussed on many edge cases like<ul><li>series is increasing only<li>series is decreasing only<li>decreasing series first and then increasing<li>series where increasing first then decreasing and then increasing again and then decreasing\xe2\x80\xa6</li></li></li></li></ul><p>let\xe2\x80\x99s say an array [0, 10, 20, 30, 25, 20, 40, 60, 50, 30] -&gt; firstly it increases, then decreases and then same repeats, so answer in this case will be 30<li>Given an array of integers, find maximal product triplet \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/three-great-candidates0515/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/three-great-candidates0515/1</a><p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s take an array [1, -4, 3, -6, 7, 0] -&gt; answer will be 168 (-6 x -4 x 7)<p>We discussed on edge cases like<ul><li>If input array contains less than three numbers<li>input array containing only negative numbers<li>input array containing both positive and negative numbers</li></li></li></ul></p></p></li></p></p></p></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4: </strong>This round consisted of coding questions, behavioral questions and some technical questions<ol><li>The behavioral question was: Tell us about a time when you had to solve a complex task under strict timeline? What was your approach and how you solved it?<li>Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d.<p>https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/<p>Clarified on some questions like<ul><li>If length of string s is less than length of string t<li>If either string s or t is empty</li></li></ul><li>Find a triplet in an array whose sum is closest to a given number.<p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problem-page.php?pid=702023">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problem-page.php?pid=702023</a><p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s take an array say [-1, 2, 1, -4] and sum = 1 -&gt; the triplet will (-1, 2, 1)<p>We discussed on edge cases like<ul><li>What will be the output if triplet is not present<li>If there are multiple triplets, then which triplet to print (interviewer confirmed you can return any triplet)<li>what will be the output if input contains less than 3 numbers</li></li></li></ul></p></p></p></li></p></p></li></li></ol><p>Technical questions:-<ul><li>Difference between child process &amp; thread process<li>What are the different transport layer protocols?<li>Difference between TCP &amp; UDP<li>Real life application of binary search tree</li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong><u>Final Verdict: Selected</u></strong><p>So I\xe2\x80\x99ve few tips to share which are as follows:-<ul><li>Recall your previous work experience, your graduation days, achievements. This is required especially to answer behavioral based questions<li>While answering behavioral questions use STAR method to answer.<ul><li>S \xe2\x80\x93 Situation ( What was the situation )<li>T \xe2\x80\x93 Task ( What was the task undertaken )<li>A \xe2\x80\x93 Action ( What you did or what was your approach to solve the task )<li>R \xe2\x80\x93 Result ( What is the end result )</li></li></li></li></ul><li>Always discuss brute force approach first and then work your way up towards optimal solution<li>Discuss time and space complexity of both brute force and optimal solution<li>Discuss about the edge cases as well<li>Having solid and excellent understanding of data structures will help you a lot in coding interviews<li>Please practice 1 coding problem daily. Leetcode and Geeksforgeeks are really great platforms to practice coding problems<li>Do not forget to add your achievements as well while in the interview<li>Believe in yourself and you\xe2\x80\x99re half way there.<li>Set short term goals as small step taken today yields to bigger step for tomorrow.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>Finally I wish you all the best. Good luck.
