Random pointer points to any other node in the tree.</a><br/><strong>Interview Experience F2F (Onsite):</strong><p><strong>Round A with HM :</strong><br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Check for a complete cycle in a graph.</a> ( A complete cycle is one that covers all nodes )<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/construct-tree-1/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Construct a tree using Preorder and Inorder Traversal</a>.<br/>3.

Given a string and k, arrange the string so that all the same characters are K distance apart. If not possible print -1.<p><strong>Round D BR :</strong><br/>1. Given two arrays sort the first array in the order of numbers given in the second array. For the numbers that do not appear in the second array, sort according to face value. Discussed methods and codes. He always pushed to optimize the code.<p>This was followed by discussion on sorting techniques, there comparisons. In the end he asked a few questions from OS mainly the scheduling algorithms.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
