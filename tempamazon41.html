I gave the test along time back, don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly remember the questions but I was able to do only one of them completely.<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> I would suggest doing coding practice from sites like GeeksforGeeks, Leetcode etc as it will give the confidence to solve problems.<p><strong>Tips:</strong>\xc2\xa0<ul><li>Don\xe2\x80\x99t spend too much time on the first question you pick, if you are not able to do the first one try doing the second.<li>I got a call for the interview along time later.<li>I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for interviewed at that time, I asked for few weeks of time for preparation and they gave me around 1-2 weeks.</li></li></li></ul><p>3 rounds of Interviews was scheduled one day.<p><strong>Round 2(Technical Interview Round 1): </strong>The interviewer was SDE3, He asked for an introduction.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li>Then he asked me a coding question on Complete Binary tree. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly about complete binary tree so he explained me.<li>Question: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-value-k-in-given-complete-binary-tree-with-values-indexed-from-1-to-n/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-value-k-in-given-complete-binary-tree-with-values-indexed-from-1-to-n/</a><li>I never did the question before so I took time to understand a complete binary tree and then come with a solution in O(logN) time complexity. I started with basics and first gave a solution in O(N) time complexity then optimized it later.<li>Then he asked me another question related to it.<li>Question: Determine number of nodes in given Complete Binary Tree with values indexed from 1 to N.<li>He asked me to use the 1st question solution and come up with an optimized solution for 2nd question, which I did quickly.<li>He seems okay as I did the second question really quick.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Tips: </strong>Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard about the question before, try to understand the question and the interviewer will also drop some hints, try to pick them.<p><strong>Round 3(Technical Interview Round 2): </strong>It was taken by 2 interviewers but only one of them was asking questions.<ul><li>Initially they asked for an intro, then about projects I did in my previous company.<li>They asked me some leadership principle(LP) questions. I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly remember the LP questions but one of them was like :<li>What is the most challenging project you did previously and how did you manage?<li>Then he asked me two question:<li>Question 1: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/</a><li>He asked me the approach first and then asked to code, he asked why I used list instead of dequeue? and what is the time complexity of each operation?<li>Question 2: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-n-ropes-minimum-cost/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-n-ropes-minimum-cost/</a><li>I did both the question in the most optimized way and wrote the code for both of them.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>Tips: Just doing the question isn\xe2\x80\x99t important, you should also know why you are using certain data structure and not any other.<p>While practicing question, try to understand the data structure that you are using.<p><strong>Round 4(Managerial Round): </strong>It consists of basic questions like\xc2\xa0<ul><li>What is acid properties?<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-and-https/">What is the difference between http and https.</a><li>Then he asked me leadership questions which I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly remember.</li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong>\xc2\xa0<ul><li>In all of the leadership questions, you have to answer using your past experiences and include any of the leadership principles in your answer.<li>Try to answer the exact question which is asked from you.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 5(Technical Round): </strong>They asked me 1 coding question and 1-2 LP questions.<ul><li>When did you exceed your deadline for a given task? What did your manager said and how did you manage?<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-meetings-in-one-room/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-meetings-in-one-room/</a></li></li></ul><p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Selected, I accepted the offer.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
