Find the SQRT of a number.<p>2. Simulate <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-level-order-traversal/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reversed level order traversal</a>.<p><strong>Three F2Fs.</strong><br/>F2F 1:<br/>1. Given a binary tree, no two adjacent nodes have same color, but all leaves should be in same color. You can fill only with two colors. Write a function to find whether a given tree can be colored using above scenario.<p>2. Given a binary tree, change the right pointer of every leaf node to the next leaf node (right to it but may be on different level).<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>3. Given a class with n people,where each people plays a game with all other people. Results are with you. You have to arrange them in a queue with a condition that, a[i] should have won a[i-1], for all I, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to care about a[i-2] . (a[i] may win or lose a[i-2]).<p><strong>F2F 2:</strong><br/>1. Write prime numbers from 1 to 100000.<p>2. Another simple question from tree. can\xe2\x80\x99t remember \xf0\x9f\x99\x81<p>3. Question from probability. Given c containers, r red balls, g green balls. Give a condition that if a guy randomly pick a ball from any of the containers, it should be red.(more probable)<p><strong>F2F 3:</strong><br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reverse a linked list </a>iteratively, recursively.(Ice breaking question :P)<p>2. Given a matrix with 1s and 0s, u have to construct a matrix such that a[i][j]=1, if only every element in ith row and jth column is 1, otherwise 0. You have to use constant space and O(mn) time complexity.<p>3. Maze solve problem. Given a matrix with 1s and 0s, 0 represents free path, 1 represents blocked area, and you can move in any of the 8 directions. Find the path from source to destination and print it. Then he told me that he can change destination at run time. And asked me to do for that.<p>This article is contributed by Karthick Raja R.
