It consisted of 5 rounds which were all on-campus. They were as follows:<br/><strong><br/>Round 1(online)(30 minutes):</strong><br/>Consisted of 15 mcqs mostly related to c/c++ and probability. It was fairly easy and very few people were eliminated.<p><strong>Round 2(online)(1 hour):</strong><br/>We had to write two programs in this round.<p>1.A sorted list of strings interspersed with NULL in random indices is given. Return the position of a given search string. Return -1 if string not present.<br/>ex:\xe2\x80\x9da\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9dc\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6. find \xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d . o/p: 2<p>Just a simple linear search will suffice.<p>2. Given an array of integers where all the elements occur odd number of times except 3 elements which occur even number of times, find the 3 elements.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>A brute force solution is fine. You may also use a hashmap.<p>The above two rounds were hosted by cocubes.com.<p><strong>Round 3(Group fly round)(30 minutes) :</strong><p>Groups of 5 were made amongst the remaining candidates. Each group was assigned an interviewer and we were given a problem to solve.<p>Write a program to rotate a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise using constant space.<p><strong>Round 4(F2F)(90 minutes):</strong><br/>The interviewer asked a lot of questions about my projects. Spent about 30 minutes on questions related to NLP and machine learning. Asked me about SVMs, neural nets, back propagation etc.<p>Then he moved on to programming questions. I was asked to program a regular expression(regex) matcher. Given a pattern string and an input string return true if the two match. The regex special characters like * and ? had to be taken into consideration. Basically if there is a \xe2\x80\x98?\xe2\x80\x99 in the pattern string any character in the input string can take its place. Same goes for \xe2\x80\x98*\xe2\x80\x99 but in this case any number of characters can replace it in the input string.<pre>\r\nExample: a*b matches acdb\r\n         a?b matches acb\r\n         a*b does not match bca\r\n         a?b does not match acdb </pre><p>The rest of the interview involved making modifications to this program. For example, modify the program so that it returns true on a partial match, i.e. even if the pattern is present inside the input string.<p><strong>Round 5(F2F):</strong><br/>This round started with questions like why do you want to work for microsoft? Tell something about yourself etc.<br/>Then came the final round of technical questions.<br/>I was asked to write 2 programs and answer some theoretical questions.<br/>1. Given a MxN matrix of 0s and 1s convert all rows and columns to 0 which have at least one 0 in them. You can use O(m) space.<br/>2. Given a matrix of characters and an input string, return true if the string is present in the matrix.<pre>\r\ninput string = ABCDE\r\nMatrix =  A    T   G\r\n          B   E    H\r\n          C   D    V</pre><p>Output: string is present.<p><strong>Some final questions:</strong><br/>1. Some questions about b trees. Don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the exact questions.<br/>2. Describe an algorithm to balance a binary search tree.<br/>3. Describe another algorithm for the same.<p>This was the final round.<p>I would like to thank the geeksforgeeks team for providing us with such a fantastic platform.<p>Hope this helps at least some of you.<p>Thank you.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
