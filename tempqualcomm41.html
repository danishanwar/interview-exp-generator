Second round was technical F2F. I was lucky to have a panel member from ECE and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about Data Structures(I\xe2\x80\x99m from IT :-P). So, he asked some basic datastructure questions:<ul><li>Name any some of the data structures you know \xe2\x80\x93 I told linked lists, stacks, queues and trees, etc<li>He started with Linked list and asked code for reversal of linked list<li>Deleting a particular node in a Circular Linked List<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-search/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Binary Search</a> logic and its code<li>Any other search algorithms he asked and I said Linear search, etc<li>Time complexity comparison of different search algorithms<li>Then, he moved onto Trees<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-for-balanced-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">What is balancing of a tree?How to do it?</a><li>What is AVL tree?(He asked to explain and made me to balance an AVL tree as well as write a code for it)<li>Types of trees.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>That\xe2\x80\x99s it, the first round was a piece of cake and I immediately got into the third round.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><b>Round III(F2F-technical)</b><p><b>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 </b>This time I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so lucky and I bumped into a CSE background guy : ( .Though, he asked some tricky questions, I was able to answer most of them.<p><b><i>Operating Systems:</i></b><ul><li>What are the different types of OS.<li>Do you know RTOS?<li>What are its types?<li>How do you implement RTOS?<li>How to achieve zero error rate in Hard RTOS?<li>What is semaphore?<li>What is a monitor?<li>Difference between them</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><b>C/C++:</b><ul><li>First question was how do you rate your knowledge in C/C++?- I told 8-9 out of 10.So, he started asking.<li>Difference between Macro and Inline?<li>What is the new thing you learned about C/C++? (I told him how to calculate sizeof without using sizeof() operator)<li>What\xe2\x80\x99s the silliest mistake you\xe2\x80\x99ve done and after recognising the mistake, you thought as ohh !!! this simple mistake I made??<li>Structure Padding question:<br/>struct temp{int a ;char b;int c;}<br/>What is the sizeof this structure?<b>Answer</b>:12(not 9 because of structure padding)</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>\xc2\xa0<p><b>Round IV:(HR)</b><br/>This round was mostly chatting with the HR like what\xe2\x80\x99s your passion?, will your life goals be achieved if you join Qualcomm?, Why Qualcomm?, What\xe2\x80\x99s your location preference?, What domain would you like to work with Qualcomm?, etc .<p>Qualcomm interview was a cakewalk for me, only con is I waited for a long time for each of the rounds, but that pain brings a pleasure at the end, I got selected \xc2\xa0\xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using <a href="http://www.contribute.geeksforgeeks.org">contribute.geeksforgeeks.org</a> or mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
