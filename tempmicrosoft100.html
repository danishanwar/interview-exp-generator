Around 40+ candidates of more than 3 years of experience had been called. Everyone was made to wait, and it was too stressful on the candidates \xe2\x80\x93 due to the long wait time, and the panel \xe2\x80\x93 due to the high number of candidates to be interviewed. I had two rounds. Each round was less than 30 minutes and very short. Not sure if it is because I gave the answer right away or because the interviewers were not interested (seemed like it).<p><strong>First round:</strong><ul><li>Tell me about yourself.<li>About my current work and job.<li>Then asked one coding question. That was <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-array-rotation-continued-reversal-algorithm/">Reversal algorithm for array rotation.</a><br/>He asked to propose any solution first and then optimize it. I said I have encountered this question and know the optimal solution with O(n) time and O(1) space. He asked to explain the solution and then code it. Once I completed, he asked to do unit test and say a few test cases, I did it, that was it.</li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Second round:</strong><ul><li>Few questions about my current work and job<li>One coding question. That was <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-linked-list-with-next-and-arbit-pointer/">Clone LL with random pointer</a>.<br/>I had not known this question before and I came up with hashing based implementation. The interviewer asked me to write it down, and once done he asked me for alternative implementations. I suggested two other methods all with O(n) extra space, but he wanted with O(1) extra space. I could not come up with it and be asked to leave.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Other people who interviewed with me got the following questions:</strong><ul><li>Implement singleton design pattern.<li>Clone Circular Linked List.</li></li></ul><p>The overall interview experience was very bad. I had to wait for more than 7 hours just to give 30 minutes of the interview. The interviewers did not discuss or participate in problem-solving, once I solved the given problem, the interview was over. Also, they seemed very disinterested in the entire interview process. HR co-ordination was also very bad. Both interviewers did not have my resume and had someone else\xe2\x80\x99s resume \xe2\x80\x93 so it was irritating. The major focus was on the array, Linked List and design.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
