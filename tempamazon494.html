The Next just greater Element for an element x is the just greater element on the right side of x in array. Return the same element if there is no greater element present on right side, or if same element is present again on right side (in case of duplicates)<pre>\r\nFor e.g. given input array : 3,5,8,4,2,6,3\r\noutput should be : 3,6,8,6,3,6,6\r\n</pre><p><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-larger-element/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><br/>Solved it using Binary search tree</p></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Face to Face Rounds?</strong><br/>Interviewers were very very helpful, and were focused on approach, they will ask basic brute force solution first, then an optimum solution, after that they may increase the complexity of problem a little bit, and if you are able to explain your approach satisfactorily, then will ask you to write production level code in any programming language of your choice, covering all edge cases using pen and paper :<ol><li>Find an element in an unsorted array such that all left elements are smaller and all right elements are greater.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/unsorted-array/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><br/>O(n) time complexity solution is required.<li>Find kth smallest element in row wise column wise sorted matrix.

Do you have bugs in code, how you correct. Have any bug from your code reached production. What you do outside of work, do you have any open source contribution, etc.<li>Given any two nodes in a binary tree, find the path from 1st node to another, and tell if the path is a straight line, or there are turns on the line, find number of turns.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-of-turns-in-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>Detailed discussion about java hashmap, hashset, its internal working and its complexity.<li>Lots of behavioural questions like, most complex thing done, how you did it, what challenges you faced, negative feedback you received, how you improved, and many more cross questions.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>Advice to fellow members preparing for something like Amazon :<ol><li>first get good understanding of basic data structure concepts, can refer geeksforgeeks.org section wise or any book like Narasimha Karamunchi (I referred this book), don\xe2\x80\x99t just read, but implement things.<li>Read book like Cracking The Coding Interview to learn how to answer behavioural questions. These questions are very limited, but are must for amazon.<li>Practice and solve last 40 amazon interview experience from <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org">practice.geeksforgeeks.org</a></li></li></li></ol><p>I hope this information will be helpful to all of you, wish you all the very very best.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
