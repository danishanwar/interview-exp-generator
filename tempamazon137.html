One should modify the minimum number of statements possible so that the code solves the given problem and passes all the test cases.<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Coding:</strong> Consisted of 2 medium level questions. One based on Maps, and other on Graphs.</li></li></ul><ol><li style="text-align:justify">https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/373006<li style="text-align:justify">https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/868371/amazon-oa-critical-connections</li></li></ol><ul><li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Behavioral Section:</strong> This section consists of questions that majorly focus on your personality and behavior.<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Logical Resoning:</strong> Aptitude questions, also focusing on Verbal ability.</li></li></ul><p style="text-align:justify">I received the test results after a month. The interviews were then scheduled.<h3 style="text-align:justify">Technical Interview 1: (60 mins)</h3><p style="text-align:justify">Generally, they ask 2 coding questions in this interview, but based on the question and time allotted, they can also ask you just a single question. So give your best shot right from the beginning.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p style="text-align:justify">The interviewer firstly introduced himself, and then asked me to do the same. After introduction we directly jumped into coding. They provide you with a Live Code platform.<ul><li style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-find-possible-words-board-characters/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-find-possible-words-board-characters/</a> \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<strong> (with minor twists)</strong></li></ul><p style="text-align:justify">So, this was a traversal based question, that can be solved either using BFS/DFS traversal or Trie Data structure (optimal solution). I initially began with trying out the DFS traversal. The interviewer then asked me to optimize it. Then I discussed the solution using Trie data structure. The interviewer seemed satisfied, and then asked me to code the solution.<p style="text-align:justify">The discussion went really well and coding the solution took some time. We had over-shooted the allotted time so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to ask any questions to the Interviewer.\xc2\xa0<p style="text-align:justify">After 3-4 hours, I got a call from the HR, stating that I have my 2nd interview scheduled in the next 15-20 mins.<h3 style="text-align:justify">Technical Interview 2: (60 mins)</h3><p style="text-align:justify">The interview began in the same way as the previous one, with introduction from both sides. I was then asked to brief about any one of my projects. After this, we began with the coding part.<ul><li style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/</a> : This required a slight variation of Binary search algorithm. I, as usual began with a brute force approach. After, that the interviewer wanted an optimized approach. I tried out some recursive solution using modification of binary search but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work well. Later on after many hints from the interviewer I was able to solve the question.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify">\xc2\xa0<ul><li style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-left-view-binary-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-left-view-binary-tree/</a> : This was also a slight variation of BFS traversal on a tree. To begin with, I discussed the solution first and then the interviewer asked me to code it.</li></ul><p style="text-align:justify">Then the interviewer asked me if I had any questions for him, after which the round ended.<h4 style="text-align:justify">Final Verdict: REJECTED</h4><p style="text-align:justify">I think I took a lot of hints from the interviewer on the first question, that led to me being rejected.\xc2\xa0<h3 style="text-align:justify">Important Take-aways:</h3><p style="text-align:justify">Sometimes, if we fail at our first try, we should look at problems from a wider perspective, as a fresh problem. That would surely help.<p style="text-align:justify">Keep on conversing with the interviewer. He\xe2\x80\x99ll surely help you in finding the right way. Just listen to them carefully.<p style="text-align:justify">Try tracing out sample inputs before confirming the solution.<p style="text-align:justify">And lastly, All the Best for your interviews. Stay calm and composed. Give your Best Shot right from the beginning.<p style="text-align:justify">Always remember, <i><strong><u>What defines us is how well we RISE after Falling.</u></strong></i> Everything else, is just a part of our LIFE.<p style="text-align:justify">\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
