Also a few programming questions were asked to some candidates.These 2 rounds and the managerial\xc2\xa0round were more of elimination rounds.<p><strong>Round 3: </strong>The final round comprised of 2 more interviews-managerial and HR.The managerial interview questions were related to project work, various difficulties faced and various scenario/situation-type questions.The HR interview was also about life experiences and scenarios.The trick is to be completely honest and have a solid justification for all the answers.<p>The interviewers were quite co-operative and understanding.It was really a great experience.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
