It consisted of 50 questions, of which 30 were aptitude based and 20 were technical.<br/>30 aptitude based questions consisted of speed-time based, probability, etc.<br/>20 technical question included C outputs, flowchart, finding correct code for prime no, Fibonacci no, etc.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Coding Round(60 mins)(31-7-12)</strong><br/>Three questions were there<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rotate-matrix-90-degree-without-using-extra-space-set-2/">You have to rotate an n*n array right by 90 degree.</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-a-linked-list-of-0s-1s-or-2s/">Given a linked list containing 0s,1s or 2s. Sort it</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fix-two-swapped-nodes-of-bst/">Two elements of BST are swapped by mistake. You have to restore the tree without changing its structure.</a><p>Note that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to write a function only, as happens in Amazon. Instead you are expected to write it from scratch along with main function and all the helping functions.<br/>My advice: Screw the instruction, write the function you are expected to write for all the three questions, then go for helping functions and main function.</p></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Personal Interview(3-8-12)</strong><p><strong>Round 1(40 mins):</strong><ol><li>A binary tree is given. You have to check whether left node data is greater than right node data for all nodes.<br/>My Query: What if either one of the left or right subtree is not present.<br/>Clarification: You can then assume max possible value for left data, if absent and min value for right node data.<br/>I was asked to dry run my code for a tree. Also test cases were asked to check my code.</li></ol><p><strong>Round 2(80 mins):</strong><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-successor-in-binary-search-tree/">To find Inorder successor of a node in a binary tree, </a>provided you have parent pointer.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-successor-in-binary-search-tree/">To find Inorder successor of a node in a<br/>binary tree,provided you do not have parent pointer.</a> Test cases for both of them were asked.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-linked-list-with-next-and-arbit-pointer/">Given a linked list a random ptr also exists. Clone the original linked list.</a> Also give the test cases.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-and-implement-special-stack-data-structure/">Construct a data structure which can push, pop and find minimum in O(1) time.</a> Was asked to code it. Test cases were also asked and was asked to ensure that it works for duplicate elements also<p>.</p></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3(80 mins):</strong><ol><li>A file consists of numerous words in it. You have to print the 10 most frequent words. Data structures to be used were asked and was asked to finally code it.<li>Test cases were asked for a railway portal.<li>A function was there which accepts a number k and a linked list and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-every-k-th-node-linked-list/">deletes every kth node of that list. </a>A function to test the correctness of the above function was expected to be coded.<li>An extension of Question 3. What if function accepted an array of numbers instead of just one number and deleted multiples of array elements.</li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4(40 mins):</strong><ol>This round was easiest of all.</ol></p><li><strong>Question 1:</strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-your-own-strcmp-which-ignores-cases/"> Write a modified strcmp function</a> which ignores cases and returns -1 if s1 &lt; s2, 0 if s1 = s2, else returns 1. Test cases were asked, as usual.<li><strong>Question 2:</strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-determine-if-a-binary-tree-is-balanced/"> Write a function which checks whether the tree is height balanced or not.</a> Give test cases also.<p>To my great relief, this time I was hired\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6.finally\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6. \xf0\x9f\x98\x80<br/>This article is compiled by <strong>Vinay Khetan</strong>.
