But the use of gray code was required.The interviewer helped me to get to the soln.<p>Q4: Sort a nearly sorted (or K sorted) array.<p>Interviewer hinted to use searching algo.I got the point to use insertion sort.<br/>Then he asked if i could use any data structure to optimize it .I used heap .<br/>There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any time pressure .If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting any idea of how to start , interviewer will give you suggestions.<br/>Do a dry run on paper to explain your code.<p>He moved to cse fundamentals :<br/>1- Explain on paper Deadlock.<br/>2-Elucidate inheritance.<br/>3-Asked for preference JAVA /C++. I said java.<br/>4-Does JAVA support multiple inheritance?<p>He expected me to explain the diamond problem with a clear example.<br/>At last, asked me if I had any questions for him.<p>This is a great opportunity to showcase your oratory skills. I Asked about current projects, domain of intern work which would be given.<p>The interviewer was really helpful in steering my way to get to the optimized soln by giving constantly hints.Its just that you need to speak out your thought process.<p>I would like to owe 80% of my success in cracking amazon interview to GFG who have beautifully curated sections like :<p>1-AMAZON Interview Experiences.<p>2-<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-do-coding-questions-for-companies-like-amazon-microsoft-adobe/</a><p>3-<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-coding-questions-company-wise/#amazon">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/must-coding-questions-company-wise/#amazon</a><p>I must say there was a huge questions question resemblance that helped me to get on to the solution approach in time quickly.<p>I am really proud &amp; elated from being an avid reader of AMAZON Interview Experiences to being a writer of one.<p>GFG is a must-read to crack such tech-giants company.<br/>THAAANXXX TEAM GFG.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
