(<strong>Expected time complexity O(log N </strong>))<li>The interviewer asked this Q in typical Fashion, basically, the Q was similar to finding the min element in a given stream of numbers.</li></li></ul><p>He was initially checking my approach. After that, he asked me to code on paper.<br/>The interviewer was really helpful, I got stuck once while implementing but he gave me a hint and after that, I was able to code correctly handle all corner cases.<br/>Around 20 students were selected for the next round.<br/><strong>Round 2:</strong>( 60 minutes)<br/>This was purely coding round. Initially, the interviewer introduced himself and after that asked me to give a brief introduction of myself.<br/>He asked me 3 coding Questions:<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-bst-from-given-preorder-traversa/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/construct-bst-from-given-preorder-traversa/</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pairwise-swap-elements-of-a-given-linked-list/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pairwise-swap-elements-of-a-given-linked-list/</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-distance-k-given-node-binary-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-distance-k-given-node-binary-tree/</a></li></li></li></ol><p>I was able to solve all the three problems optimally and he asked me to code them on paper.<br/>After that, he asked me another coding Q(extension of 3rd Q),<br/>To print all nodes which are at a distance of given range [a, b].<br/>He just wants to check my approach for this Q, and I was able to crack the same.<br/>The interviewer was looking for the most optimized approach for all the questions.<br/>After this Round, 12 students were selected for a 6-months internship and 4 were shortlisted for further rounds.<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Technical round, This round lasted for nearly 2 hrs.<br/>The round started with a project discussion(20 mins).<p>After that, he asked me a few coding questions:<ol><li>Modular exponentiation.<li>A simple dynamic programming Q(I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the actual Q)<li>Implementing queue from 2 stacks and vice versa.<li>Merge sort, quick sort, heap sort.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>There were a few more Q based on Data structure, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.<br/>After that, he asked me some theoretical questions on c++, as I mentioned in my resume.<p>Then he asked me the concepts of oops. Some of the questions that I remember are:<ol><li>What is dangling pointer?<li>Reference variable VS pointer.<li>Garbage collector, memory leak.<li>Virtual function and polymorphism.<li>verflow and underflow etc\xe2\x80\xa6</li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>Finally, the interviewer shared his experience in Amazon and asked me if I have any questions to ask.<br/>3 of us were selected for the next round.<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> (Bar Raiser) This round was held on Amazon chime, The round lasted for 90 minutes.<ol><li>Tell me about yourself.</li></ol><p>After that, he asked me to explain my machine learning project, I gave him a detailed explanation of the same. Luckily the interviewer had worked on some ML projects, so explaining my project logic was easy to him. There was a 30 mins discussion on my project which involved several cross-questions like, why CNN, what technology I used, how I trained such a huge dataset, discussion on the model that I implemented, how did I analyzed and preprocessed the images, etc. After that, he asked me for the recent blogs I have read. After this he asked a coding question:<ol><li>Given a Linked list find if there is a loop in it, if yes find the starting point of the loop and also the total nodes that are outside the loop.</li></ol><p>I gave him 3 approaches to solve this problem. He asked me the proof of the Floyds cycle algorithm. I did the proof by writing all the required diagrams and equations and he was satisfied with it and then I wrote the code.<br/>Result: Selected for FTE \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
