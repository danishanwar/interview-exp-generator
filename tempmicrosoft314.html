Print its level order traversal in reverse order level wise .eg if level order is 1234567 then required output was 1327654<p>Question 2: Given a binary search tree , Print its zig zag traversal .<p>Complete syntactically correct code was required with all corner cases covered .<p><strong>Round-2(Technical)</strong><br/>He asked me to Introduce myself and then started asking me about my project<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>1. Print the given matrix in spiral order .<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/</a><p>Code should be syntactically correct with all corner cases handled in a single attempt.<p>2.Count all possible decodings of a given digit sequence .<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-possible-decodings-given-digit-sequence/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-possible-decodings-given-digit-sequence/</a><p>Initially I started off with a recursive solution and came up with Dynamic programming solution afterwards. Full working code was required without any corner case missing.<p>He asked to list down all the possible test cases for the given scenario . He was very particular about the Test cases .<p><strong>Round-3(Technical)</strong><br/>He asked me to introduce myself.<p>1.He asked me about the current project which i m working on.. and a few questions on the technologies which were used in the project.He was very particular about my project discussion.<p>2. Given a linked list consisting of String in each Node . Given just a pointer to the head Node , I was required to find whether the resultant String formed by combining all the Nodes of the linked list is a palindrome or not .<p>eg \xe2\x80\x93 Consider this linked List structure<p>\xe2\x80\x9caba\xe2\x80\x9d -&gt; \xe2\x80\x9ccd\xe2\x80\x9d -&gt; \xe2\x80\x9cefe\xe2\x80\x9d -&gt; \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x9d -&gt; \xe2\x80\x9ccaba\xe2\x80\x9d<p>Hence this structure is palindrome . Was required to check for palindrome online as Linked List length could be infinite at any point of time .<p>I was required to discuss and write full code on the whiteboard starting from Node structure to the end logic .<p>After that i was required to list down Test Cases for the same .<p><strong>Round-4:(Technical)</strong><br/>He asked me to walk him through my resume.<p>1. Why Microsoft?<br/>2. Why do u want to leave your current company?<br/>3. Deep discussion on the current project which I\xe2\x80\x99m working on.<br/>4. Write code for the crossword puzzle game .I said I have not played it earlier .<p>He then asked me to discuss and write code for Sudoku game in whiteboard. I wrote it using Backtracking<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-set-7-suduku/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-set-7-suduku/</a><p>5. Suggest some improvement which u can carry out in Microsoft Office .<p><strong>Round-5 (HR)</strong><br/>1.Discussion on current compensation etc.<p>A big Thanks to GeeksforGeeks for providing such a brilliant platform for interview preparation .Keep up the good work \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
