I just happened to get knowledge of their opportunities from a friend. I had applied, but did not really think about getting shortlisted. However, my resume for shortlisted and I received an email to choose a date for telephonic interview. I had given the 1st round interview, and could not clear it. I would however like to share my interview experience.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: Approximately how many lines of code have you written till now?\xc2\xa0<p>I answered this question in a very subjective and calculative manner. I counted the number of courses and approximately the number of projects I had done till the time. Then I fixed an average code size for each project. And gave him an approximate answer. He seemed to be satisfied with the approach.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: Given a file with large number of sentences, choose a sentence randomly where all sentences have equal probability.\xc2\xa0<p>I could not really solve this question. I gave him few approaches like counting number of sentences and then choosing a random between and then choosing a line. However, I later realized I could have normalized the sentence length by subtracting mean length and dividing by standard variance. But I am not sure if this approach would have satisfied the interviewer.\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>These were the only technical questions asked.\xc2\xa0<p>Below are a few behavioral questions I was asked.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: What was the biggest problem you faced till now while developing a project and how did you resolve it?\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: What would you do if you feel biased towards a team member during an ongoing project?\xc2\xa0<p>And with this the interview was completed.<br/>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
