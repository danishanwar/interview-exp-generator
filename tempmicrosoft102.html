We need to discuss our approach and then write the code on paper.<ol><li>Find the leftmost right cousin of a given binary tree<br/>Eg:<pre><code>\xc2\xa0A\r\n       /   <span class="hljs-string">\\</span>\r\n      B     C\r\n     / <span class="hljs-string">\\</span>   /  <span class="hljs-string">\\</span>\r\n    D   E F    G\r\n</code></pre></li></ol><p>So the left most right cousin of D is F, E is F, F is NULL, G is NULL<ol start="2"><li>Given a list of words return those words which contain other words as its prefix.<br/>Eg: [\xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cafter\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cafterwords\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cb\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cbe\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\xe2\x80\x9d]<br/>Output: [\xe2\x80\x9cafterwords\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\xe2\x80\x9d]</li></ol><p>I could solve both the code and wrote it on paper cleanly with proper comments.<p><strong>Next three rounds of F2F interview happened on 1/12/19</strong><br/>Total 3 round took 2.5 hrs<p><strong>Round 3: F2F interview</strong><br/>The interviewer was excellent, helped me to calm down. Then asked me the\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-get-the-intersection-point-of-two-linked-lists/">intersection of two link list</a> question. I explained two approaches and then wrote the code on paper.<p><strong>Round 4: F2F interview</strong><br/>The interviewer asked me two questions:<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-ladder-problem-2/">Snake and ladder</a><li>Given a list of edges E and list of vertex pairs V. Check if we can create a graph using edges in E such that no pair of vertices in V are connected. Consider both direct and indirect connection.</li></li></ol><p>I gave two-three approaches for both questions. The interviewer asked me to write code of 2nd question, when I wrote half of the code, he said time is up.<p><strong>Round 3: F2F interview</strong><br/>Asked me one question:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/">merge two sorted lists</a><br/>There can be a duplicate, but the final list should be distinct. i.e. each duplicate should be taken once.<br/>The interviewer asked me to provide at least three approaches. Asked me to write code for the two approaches out of three I could answer. I gave a recursive approach, an approach where we take e extra head pointer and another approach where I was inserting the node of the 1st link list in 2nd one \xe2\x80\x94 coded 1st two approach.<p>After waiting for 5 min, the HR informed me that they are giving me the offer.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
