There were two telephonic rounds followed by 4 F2F rounds.<p>Telephonic Round 1 :<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94<br/>He seemed a bit unprepared for the interview. He started with some introduction and knowledge transfer about current work and then created a binary tree and asked me to write the level order, preorder, postorder and inorder traversals for that tree.<br/>Then, the coding questions followed.<p>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/flattening-a-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flattening a multi-level linked list.</a><br/>1st approach \xe2\x80\x93&gt; Using a queue : T = O(n), S = O(n). Coded it.<br/>2nd approach \xe2\x80\x93&gt; Same as on GeeksForGeeks &lt; <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/flattening-a-linked-list/1">Flattening a Linked List </a>&gt; : Didnt ask me to code. But this one requires changing the structure of data.<p>2) Flattening a multi-level linked list but the nodes in depth should be printed first. So, basically the 1st question resembles BFS and this one resembles DFS. Did this using recursion very easily.<p>3) Process vs Threads. What happens when you type in a URL? High-level design. Handshaking protocol. HTTPS protocol, etc<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<br/>Telephonic Round 2 :<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94<br/>I must say this guy who interviewed me was really smart. This round was a little more than 1 hour and there were 3 questions.<p>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-tree-to-dll/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BST to Singly Linked List in place. A slight modification of this problem</a> Coded it.<p>2) Finding Squares on the chessboard attackable by a rook<br/>There is an NxN chessboard. Each square on the chessboard can be either empty or can have a rook. A rook as we know can attack either horizontally or vertically. Given a 2D matrix where 0 represents an empty square and 1 represents a rook, we have to fill in all the cells in the matrix with 1 which represent squares that can be attacked by any rook present on the chessboard. One can find a much simpler version of this problem here \xe2\x80\x94<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/boolean-matrix-problem/0">Boolean Matrix Problem</a><p>3) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/buildings-receiving-sunlight/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">An array of buildings is facing the sun. The heights of the building is given in an array. You have to tell which all buildings will see the sunset.</a> This is pretty easy. The first building will definitely see the sunset and for the rest of the buildings, just maintain a variable max_height_seen_so_far and check with the height of the current building. However, he then twisted the question and asked what my approach would be if I was to scan the buildings from back to front rather than front to end. I used a stack and applied the logic similar to that used in Next Greater Element problem.<p><a href="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Facing_the_sun.jpg"><img alt="Capture" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-134916" height="290" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Facing_the_sun.jpg" width="444"/></a><p>\xc2\xa0<br/>F2F R1:<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x93<br/>Started with introduction. A lot of questions about current company, current work, current project and then a design question.<p>How would you design the meeting invite feature of Microsoft Outlook? Considering each meeting invite as an object and that Web server is the storage space for the invites, design a data structure to receive and send invites to user in an efficient manner. The message objects must be received in a sorted manner based on the time of meeting. I suggested using a Binary Search Tree and justified the use of this DS. I gave an O(NlogN) solution. I was then asked to code it. I coded it in C#.<p>Followed with a lot of HR questions.<p>\xc2\xa0<br/>F2F R2:<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x93<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-array-in-groups/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reverse a sub array in an array.</a> Pretty easy.<p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-and-delete/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rotate a subarray in an array where start and end indices of the sub array are provided and \xe2\x80\x98k\xe2\x80\x99 is provided which is the number of rotations to be done.</a> The interviewer behaved really dumb in this question. All he wanted was a solution. He made me dry run the code again and again and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really bothered about the concept or the approach. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he could relate to my solution which was O(n) in time and O(1) in space.<p>3) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-loop-in-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find if a linked list has a loop.</a> Old question. Take a fast and a slow pointer. But to get this solution wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really his motive. He asked why slow pointer should move by one node at a time and why the fast pointer should move at the speed of two nodes at a time. As led by the discussion, I was then asked to find the optimal speeds of slow and fast pointers for a given linked list. Again, led by the discussion, he asked if it\xe2\x80\x99s given that the linked list has a loop and the size of the loop is given, can I find the optimal speeds of the slow and fast pointers?<p>\xc2\xa0<br/>F2F R3:<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x93<br/>1) Same question as Q3 asked in telephonic round with the only difference that the heights of the buildings was provided in a linked list. Coded it in C. Then, the interviewer twisted the question by placing the sun after the last building(previously the sun was placed before the first building). Used a stack. However, this can simply be done by the reversing the heights array and using the same function written for the first part of the problem.<p>2) Design a data structure to represent the hierarchy of employees in an organization. Also, the design should be such that, you can retrieve the no. of reportees of a manager(not just the direct reportees but all the employees under him) very fast(O(1) was expected). Also, insertion of a new employee and removal of an employee should be fast too.<p>I suggested using a n-ary tree of hash tables. Also, used an additional hash table where key was employeeId and value was the address of the hash table (or the node) in the n-ary tree. My solution did give no. of reportees in O(1) and addition and removal of employees was in O(n) time, where n is the total number of employees. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough time to code though.<p>\xc2\xa0<br/>F2F R4:<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x93<br/>This round had a lot of HR questions. Cultural info. Current project. He also asked coding questions but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really bothered about the optimality of the solution.<p>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/fixed-two-nodes-of-a-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Two nodes in a BST are swapped. Find them</a>. Told my approach. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to code it.<p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/permutations-of-a-given-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Print all the permutations of a string in lexicographic</a> order. Coded it. Took me a lot of dry runs to make him understand that the code is correct \xf0\x9f\x98\x80<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
