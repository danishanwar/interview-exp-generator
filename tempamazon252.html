Then he asked me to design a algo for how to maintain server-load with load Balancer.(Not able to answer it basically he want to answer something like round robin type algorithm.)[This question was ask on the basis of my current work]<p>Now he jump to coding questions.<ol><li>Given a data made up of BST which is dynamic(i.e nodes keep on adding as the user enter new details) he want me to convert that BST to Complete tree.[Have a healthy discussion on it about 10-15 min i gave him solution with rotations like in AVL and ultimately at end he agreed with a solution consist of in-order which run on the Batch basis.].Then he told me to code the function which take tree as input and return root by changing it to complete tree.<li>Second he asked for a given a number \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99, print how many valid parenthesis strings containing \xe2\x80\x98(\xe2\x80\x98 or \xe2\x80\x98)\xe2\x80\x99 are possible of that length. I told its an application of Catalan Number then he want me to write a code to generate nth Catalan number without using formula basically he want me to write the Dynamic version of it.

Then he asked me my role in my current team and also want me to explain a situation in which i perform something which is completely different from my current role.[This is basically a Behavioural question so answer such question on the basis of there Leadership Principle.]<p>Then he jump to coding part.<ol><li>Given a number in form of link list we have to add one to that number and update the link list\xc2\xa0 accordingly.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 eg. 123 is store like 1-&gt;2-&gt;3\xc2\xa0 and adding 1 to 123 it become 124 so we have to update the list to 1-&gt;2-&gt;4.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 O(n) time and with O(1) extra space without reversing without recursion.<li>Given a playlist of songs we have to shuffled that playlist.[Basically an application of https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shuffle-a-given-array-using-fisher-yates-shuffle-algorithm/]</li></li></ol><p>After 2 weeks i received a call from HR saying that Amazon is releasing an offer of SDE1 for me.<p>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>SOME TIPS:</strong><ol><li>In all rounds you will be asked to write a production level code so be prepared for that.[But In first two round of face to face if your code is not perfect in one go and interviewer found 1, 2 corner cases which may fail in it the you may got a chance to correct it, all depend on the interviewer not sure about 3rd round as in my case i was able to write perfectt code in one go]<li>In any round if you stuck, discuss it with interviewer as they definitely help you on that.<li>But in the last round i.e with BAR Raiser make sure to write complete code and moreover your code should be production ready i.e if he/she will able to find any case which fail in your code then there will be chance of rejection as he/she only read your code and said ok thats it for the day any questions for me and finished your interview, so make sure to write a perfect code before submitting to him.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 [As one of my friend got rejected in Bar Raiser as he was not able to complete code]</li></li></li></ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
