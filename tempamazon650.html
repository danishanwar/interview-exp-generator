Here\xe2\x80\x99s my experience.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Written Exam(1hr:30mints):</strong>\xc2\xa0<br/>There were 22 questions asked in which 20 were of MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s and 2 coding questions. Most of the MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s came from OS, Algorithm, C-o/p and aptitude (directly from previous year Computer science GATE).\xc2\xa0<p>First coding question: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/1">Determine the diameter of a tree</a> (Taking input was a bit difficult as we have to take input in array of unknown size,sort it and create BST).\xc2\xa0<p>Second coding question: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-anagrams-1/0">Given a string of words seperated by comma,we have to print pair of words who are anagrams</a> line by line(case-insensitive). If you don\xe2\x80\x99t find any such pair then print -1.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Interview Rounds:</strong>\xc2\xa0<br/><strong>Round 1(1hr:15mints):</strong>\xc2\xa0<br/>1. Started with Introduction then he jumped into project and discussed about 15 mints.\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sorting-elements-of-an-array-by-frequency/0">Given an array print elements according to frequency and if two elements have same frequency then print it in decreasing order.\xc2\xa0</a><br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Gave solution using 2d matrix in O(n2). Then reduced the complexity by sing AVL tree in O(nlogn).Later coded AVL tree solution on paper.\xc2\xa0<p>3. Given a binary tree, <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree/1">print boundary traversal</a>\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I gave solution by using three traversal(as given in gfg) then he asked me to do it in single traversal. I discussed alot with him then finally came up with solution by using queue and stack data structure. Later he asked me code it and I coded correctly. He was impressed with my code.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 2(1hr):</strong>\xc2\xa0<br/>1. Started with project discussion of around 25 minutes.\xc2\xa0<br/>2. Given an array of stock prices, find maximum loss in buying and selling stocks. I gave him approach first, then he asked me to code. Coded it.\xc2\xa0<br/>3. Implement garbage collector in C without using free function.\xc2\xa0<br/>4. What is virtual inheritance.\xc2\xa0<br/>5. Explain how the file is stored in memory.\xc2\xa0<br/>6. Explain UNIX I node Implementation.\xc2\xa0<br/>7. Difference between process and threads.\xc2\xa0<br/>8. How threads are executing parallelly and how they share memory.\xc2\xa0<br/>9. Asked algorithm to schedule kernel level threads(gang scheduling).\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 3(1hr:30mints):</strong>\xc2\xa0<br/>1. Started with Introduction\xc2\xa0<br/>2. Detailed project discussion of around 45 minutes.\xc2\xa0<br/>3. Given me the Resource allocation graph with set of processess and resources, ask me to tell him the approach to execute all the process.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I told him to use topological sort suddenly he said very good and ask me to code. I coded it.\xc2\xa0<br/>4. Explain the need of synchronization with the help of example.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I explained him with use of producer-consumer and printer spooler problem(also written code for both).\xc2\xa0<br/>5. basics of synchronization i.e code for wait and signal operation and how the semaphore maintains their suspended list.\xc2\xa0<p>At the end of this round interviewer was very impressed.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 4(1hr):</strong>\xc2\xa0<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/palindrome-numbers/0">Given a integer number n, tell its binary representation is palindrome or not.</a>\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0e.g 4=100 not palindrome\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05=101 palindrome.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0TC = O(n) and SC = O(1) was expected and I coded it.\xc2\xa0<br/>2. He gave me a java code using lock on this keyword.Ask me is there any problem in the code using lock keyword when multiple threads are running concurrently. I found the problem then he ask me to resolve it and I resolved it.\xc2\xa0<br/>3. What is virtual memory. Who implements it.\xc2\xa0<br/>4. How virtual memory concept is implemented in system.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Tips:</strong>\xc2\xa0<br/>1. Interviewer don\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to give all correct answer though they want to see your approach first and how you tackle a problem which you don\xe2\x80\x99t know apriori.\xc2\xa0<br/>2. Brush up OS fundamentals thoroughly and try to practice code on paper as much as you can.\xc2\xa0<br/>3. Along with basic data structures also have some idea of advance data structures like BBST,Trie,Graphs etc.\xc2\xa0<br/>4. Think loud in front of interviewer and try to engage him all the time.\xc2\xa0<br/>5. Listen his words carefully, probalbly they will have some hints to answer.\xc2\xa0<p>I would like to thanks geeksforgeeks team for providing such a great platform. You guys are doing awesome job.\xc2\xa0<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
