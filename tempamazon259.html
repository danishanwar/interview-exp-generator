Dice throw DP etc.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 1:</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>The interviewer asked 3 questions:<p>Q1. Write code to find the path from one node to another in a binary search tree. Did it well.<p>To proceed to round 2, do one of these:<p>Q2. Write code to heapify an array. OR Find the minimum number of modifications to sort an array where one modification means to increment or decrement an element by one.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>First, the interviewer took a quickfire round from CV.<p>Then, he asked this question:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-data-structure-that-supports-insert-delete-search-and-getrandom-in-constant-time/</a><p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>I got asked this problem:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-maximum-sum-combinations-two-arrays/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-maximum-sum-combinations-two-arrays/</a><p>But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go beyond brute force solution this time and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very happy with my efforts.<p>He saw I was very exhausted and frustrated (it was day 2 slot 2, and I was being interviewed simultaneously by two companies at that time). So, he told me, it was the same story with him and he got rejected by Amazon on-campus but got in 6 months later.<p><strong>Round 4:</strong><p>I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to round 4.<p>\xc2\xa0<p>Hope this helps!<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
