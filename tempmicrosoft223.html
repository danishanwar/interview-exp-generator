The problems were fairly easy and didn\xe2\x80\x99t require much thought . Extra marks were given for optimized solutions requiring less memory and time . Problems were as follows \xe2\x80\x93<ol><li>Given 2 numbers <strong>m</strong> and <strong>n</strong> , find if the sum <strong>m+n</strong> has the same number of digits as <strong>n</strong> . If true then print <strong>m+n</strong> otherwise print <strong>n.</strong><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/length-longest-consecutive-1s-binary-representation/">Given a binary string(a string consisting only of 0s and 1s) find the length of the longest contiguous occurrence of 1s</a>.<li>Third question was to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-arithmetic-progression-dp-35/">find length of longest AP in given set of numbers</a>.</li></li></li></ol><p>From those who qualified the online coding round \xe2\x80\x93 14 people were selected for direct interview and 10 people were selected for an additional fly round . From those 10 , around 3-4 were selected for interviews.<p><strong>First Interview</strong>:<br/>The interviewer asked me to give a short introduction about myself and then based on my disciplinary electives ,<ul><li>He asked me to design a simple Information Retrieval system. Given a file containing various phrases , he asked me to provide an outline for building a query system such that it autocompletes the query the user is typing . He didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for any code , just for a basic outline of the functions that would be used and the data structures I thought would be implemented while building such a system.</li></ul><p><p><strong>Second Interview</strong>:<br/>Interviewer asked me two questions Algorithms \xe2\x80\x93 one was based on trees and DP and the other was a question on Depth First Search.<p><strong>Third Interview</strong>:<br/>Interviewer asked a simple problem<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-distance-k-given-node-binary-tree/">Print all nodes at distance k from a given node</a></li></ol><p><p>This article is contributed by <strong>Shivang Dixit</strong>.
