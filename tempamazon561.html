There were 5 rounds namely \xe2\x80\x93<br/>1) Written round<br/>2) \xe2\x80\x93 5) All technical rounds with increasing difficulty levels<p>The written round consisted of 20 mcqs ( OS, DBMS, CPP , C , JAVA and Aptitude basic level ) and two Hacker Rank coding questions \xe2\x80\x93<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-intervals/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Overlapping subsets problem</a> and<br/>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The longest path in a given binary tree</a><p>The technical rounds took 1 hour each.<p>In the first technical round I was asked to <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/complete-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check whether a given tree is a complete binary tree or not</a> and then to code both recursive and non-recursive version of it. It also included another question like to find whether a number is a power of 2 or not.<p>The 2nd technical round had questions like what is a symmetric number, how will you check if its a symmetric number. And then he asked me to find all the symmetric numbers of given n-digits. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to do the last part.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>The 3rd technical round consisted of a string compression problem. Given a string like AAABBBCDEFGHIJKLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL \xe2\x80\x93 you have to compress it to a string like A3B3C1D1E1F1G1H1K1L15. The question was to be done in O(n) and inplace.<p>The 4th technical round consisted of the popular dynamic programming problem of <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-cost-of-ropes/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cutting sticks of various length and merging them to form a bigger stick</a> keeping in mind that you have to decrease the overall cost of merging.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
