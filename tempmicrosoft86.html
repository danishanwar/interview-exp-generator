First, <strong>we have to arrange a referral</strong>. Personally, I contacted one of the Microsoft SDE. He posted one LinkedIn post on his profile. I saw that and asked him for referral through the mail. As he said, He got around <strong>1000 emails</strong> for a referral from different colleges\xe2\x80\x99 students. After his screening, He gave his referral to <strong>only 5 students</strong>. Luckily, I was in one of them. After getting a referral, I have to sit for an online coding interview round.<p>Criteria of selection for referral:<ul><li>7.0+ OGPA (Overall Grade Point Average) &amp; No Pending Backlogs<li>Strong DSA &amp; Problem Solving Skills<li>Projects &amp; Achievements<li>CodeChef &amp; CodeForces Ratings \xf0\x9f\x99\x82</li></li></li></li></ul><p>Note: Around <strong>11, 000</strong> students were selected for that online round by referrals.<p><strong>Round 1:\xc2\xa0</strong>This round was held on <strong>mettl.com. </strong>There was a pool of questions out of which everyone got <strong>3 questions in 1 hr 30 min</strong>. The questions were of easy, medium and medium level. I was asked the following:<ol><li><p class="entry-title"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array/">K\xe2\x80\x99th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array</a><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><li><p class="entry-title"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-palindrome-substring-set-1/">Longest Palindromic Substring</a><li><p class="entry-title"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/full-and-complete-binary-tree-from-given-preorder-and-postorder-traversals/">Construct Full Binary Tree from given preorder and postorder traversals</a></p></li></p></li></p></li></ol><p>In this round, I solved 2.5 problems (1= 100%, 2=%100, and 3 = 50% test score). I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to the next round. I was not good at trees and graphs. That cost me in this interview. After this, there were two onsite interviews. One of them was group fly and the last one was HR round.<p>Hope you like it!<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
