Prepare Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms for this section.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>I attempted 10 from Section 1, 15 from Section 2 and 15 from Section 3. The marking scheme was +1 for 1 correct answer and -0.25 for 1 wrong answer.Each section was of 30 mins and after this time interval, section is switched automatically.<p>About 20 students for my profile were shortlisted in this round.<p><strong>Round 2: Personal Interview<br/></strong><p>For the PI, we had to go to NIT Durgapur.<p>The first round was the first technical interview. The interviewer was quite friendly and asked for my introduction first. Then, he asked about my projects. I explained him one of my projects for about half an hour till he was satisfied with my explanation. Then, he asked about my hobbies which included playing chess. He gave me some puzzles. They were similar to this : <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-climbing-a-round-pole-of-80-metres-height-a-monkey-climbs-5-metres-in-a-minute-and-slips-2-metres-in-the-alternate-minute-How-much-time-would-the-monkey-take-to-get-to-the-top-of-the-pole">https://www.quora.com/In-climbing-a-round-pole-of-80-metres-height-a-monkey-climbs-5-metres-in-a-minute-and-slips-2-metres-in-the-alternate-minute-How-much-time-would-the-monkey-take-to-get-to-the-top-of-the-pole</a> and Name three consecutive days without using the words Monday, Thursday, or Sunday ? Answer is Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Then he asked me some questions on pointers and C. Basic questions on linked lists and trees were also asked. In the end, he asked me if I had any questions and I asked him to explain my profile which he did very well.<p>The shortlisted candidates were sent for the second technical interview. The second technical interview took about 45 minutes. In the beginning the interviewer told me to introduce myself and give an overview of my CV. He asked about my projects and internship work in detail. He asked me to draw the database of one of my projects and then some python questions. He also asked me some basic algorithms. Lastly, he asked me about my final year project and I explained it to him in details.<p>Some of my friends had a third technical interview too and some others were asked questions on OS in their second technical interview.<p><strong>Round 3: HR round<br/></strong><p>This round was basically like a formality but I would urge everyone to take this round seriously too as not everyone who made it to the HR round were selected. The interviewer was very friendly and asked basic HR questions. In the end, she asked me if I had any questions and I asked her how it is to work at Qualcomm and I got a very positive answer.<p>Finally, the results were mailed to our PC and me along with 4 others from CS were selected. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p>Also, remember to maintain a happy and pleasant face throughout each PI.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
