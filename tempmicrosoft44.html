Each round is an elimination round and AA discussion happens only if the first two go well.<li>Completed First round at noon (April 8, 2021). Received an update the same afternoon that they will be <strong>jumping to the final round (AA discussion).</strong><li>AA discussion, initially scheduled for April 9, <strong>got rescheduled</strong> to April 10 due to the unavailability of the interviewer.<li>Waiting to hear back!</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Online Test</strong><ul><li>90 mins test with 3 questions. 2 easy, 1 medium-hard (got stuck with this one).<li>First two related to strings and pattern matching (solved).<li>3rd related to puzzle solving.

Discussed optimizing and adding conditions to test the code.<li><strong>Question 2</strong> \xe2\x80\x93 Related to arrays, I used an approach similar to the priority queue approach in <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-k-sorted-arrays/1">this</a> question to solve it.<li>Was asked to code both the solutions.<li>Talked a bit more about my work, and then he asked if I had paid any attention to the security part of the website or actually implemented any. I explained what parts I had focused on and implemented on my website.<li>He repeated them and asked me to explain a specific term.<li>He asked if I have ever implemented authentication and does my website needs it. I said I had implemented it but only using built-in Django Auth Models.<li>After all that talk, he asked if I had any questions for him.<li>I asked, he explained. END</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 2</strong><ul><li>Received an Update later during noon that the team has decided to jump to the final round.</li></ul><p><strong>AA Discussion</strong><ul><li>The interviewer introduced himself and asked me to tell a bit about myself.<li>Asked me to dwell more into information about my internship.<li>I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given him any details about the product we were building and started explaining my role. After I finished, he asked me to explain first what kind of problem I was solving there. So (I mocked myself first for not starting by explaining the product) and then explained in detail.<li>He then asked me <strong>\xe2\x80\x9chow can you make your website more troubleshootable?\xe2\x80\x9d</strong> This is the question I struggled most with. Somehow I was not getting what the interviewer meant by that question. I gave him a couple of answers, but they were not accurate.<li>I admitted that I was not able to understand what he was looking for, and he said, \xe2\x80\x98we can move on from this.<li>After 20 mins of me struggling over the word <strong>troubleshooting</strong> He shared the codility link.<li>He shared the question verbally. It was related to <strong>Binary Search Tree</strong>. Pretty Simple.<li>I discussed a few approaches, and he asked me to go ahead with the coding.<li>I coded the whole solution. <strong>Modular and Structured</strong>.<li>He asked me to run it. I got <strong>3-4 errors</strong>. Silly mistakes like forgetting to pass variables in method calls. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care as I got hold of them in a second.<li>He seemed satisfied and asked if I had any questions for him. I did.<li>He asked me about <strong>how I got into this interview loop</strong> i.e, the process I followed until this AA round.<li>Then he asked me <strong>about my university</strong> and <strong>how did I compare as a student</strong> to other students at my university.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Feedback from Interviewer</strong><ul><li>After all this, he gave me some feedback and mentioned I had very good coding skills. He <strong>appreciated that the code was structured and modular</strong>.<li>He pointed out that he asked me an ambiguous question (about troubleshooting) just to see how I handle it and <strong>I got a little agitated</strong> at the point when I was unable to answer it.<li>He suggested that I <strong>should be more calm and open</strong> in situations like this.<li>I agreed and said something in acknowledgment. He continued and said that the company looks for <strong>candidates who can handle ambiguous situations</strong> but at the same time they also look for <strong>people who don\xe2\x80\x99t give up easily</strong> which he said was reflected by later part of our conversation, (conversation about my university projects).<li>We summed up.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Result</strong><p>Heard back after a long (really long) wait of 18 days!<br/>Got an offer though (????)<p><strong>Some Points To Remember</strong><ul><li>Don\xe2\x80\x99t stress yourself if your interviews get rescheduled or your interviewers join late for the meeting. These interviewers are generally seniors whose schedules remain rather busy.<li>My round 1 interviewer has been with Microsoft for over 10 years and the interviewer for the AA discussion has been with Microsoft since before I was <strong>BORN!</strong> (21 years!!!)</li></li></ul><p>Hope this helps.
