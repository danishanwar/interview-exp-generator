Given a matrix each entry in box is an integer. find row having maximum sum.<br/>Q2. Given a dice having m faces each numbered from 1\xe2\x80\xa6to ..m, the dice rolled n times. then find in how many ways a particular target sum T can be generated since ans is large we have to answer using modulo 1e9+7.<p>Approximately 70+ students are invited for off-campus drive at on of the college in Bengaluru.<p>Technical Algorithm DS interview Round 1:<br/>Q1. Interviewer was cool tried to make me comfortable he asked me about my online round at that time I only able to recognize only first question of my online round about matrix and tell him my approach [ my bad was I not able to recognize second question of dp If I would then perhaps it might impress him more]<br/>Q2.Given a one dimension array find two elements such difference b/w them is minimum.<br/>Q3.Expanded question to two sorted array then to k sorted array<br/>Q4. asked to write code for heapify. little discussion on build heap complexity [ got confused and not able to clearly explain him how complexity becomes O(n)]<p>Q5. Asked about bst, lots of discussion on bst.<br/>given a bst make it a balanced binary tree Such that its preorder traversal gives us sorted sequence. No use of extra space, only to use operation to swap any two nodes.<br/>I give him some unpolished approach. He asked am I not comfortable with trees.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>finally got selected, for round two aprrox 20 were selected for round 2.<p>Technical Round 2 : [Algo Ds] [60 min]<p>little discussion on my project [5 min]<p>Q1. asked about dynamically growing sequential list, name them and discussed about various complexity of insert, remove random access in them.<br/>myans. Discussed about Arraylist in java and linkedlist [he asked me for one more but I am not able to answer]<p>Q2. asked me about dictionary how they are internally implemented.<br/>I discussed about red black trees (bst), and hashtable and complexity of its various operation.<p>Q3. he asked me to implement a full Hashtable class which should dynamically grow as no of keys increases and handle collisions.<br/>implement methods like get(key) and put(key).<br/>myans. I implement it fully but it takes more than two A4 size pages It takes my lots of time about 40 mins finally he satisfied.<br/>he said we are running out of time so I have to solve next question very quickly.<br/>Q4. Given a string of characters you can erase K consecutive occurring characters [though I misinterpreted it as more than K consecutive occurring characters which leads me to not come up with solution] . then what is minimum length we can get, note operation can applied recursively.<br/>ans. first I gave him naive approach, then I further come up with unpolished solution using two pointers from middle. He asked for standard one.
