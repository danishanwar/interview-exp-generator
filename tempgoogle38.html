This includes Letter coding, Number patterns, Assumptions, Logical Deductions, and Relationships among various entities.<li>Keep a track of time and do not spend too much time on a question you are unsure about.<li>If you have a doubt in a particular question, visit the question once you have completed the remaining questions.</li></li></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
