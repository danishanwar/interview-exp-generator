In 1 hour we have to solve two coding questions. I have done partially the code and luckily enough got a call for the next step.<li>Before the interview, there was a webinar held to tell us the further process and making things clear to us. Then they send some materials to study and so that we can prepare for the interview. In that, there was some mock interview link also where we can take our mock interviews and practice. Meanwhile, we also got an email to provide them some available dates.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2:</strong><ol><li>The interview lasted for 45 minutes. There was only one panelist, he is a man of age around 25, not an Indian. He wants to make me feel comfortable, so he asked some general questions that show me a problem to solve, but he was more interested in asking my approach. The question was of hard level and from graphs. I tell him my approach and there were some cross-questioning from his side and after that he wants me to solve the code practically.<li>I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t able to proceed with further rounds but yes the experience is worth it.</li></li></ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
