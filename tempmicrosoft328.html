You need write a pseudo code to find the unique number. Here ans \xe2\x80\x93 4. Also asked the complexity of my code which was O (n).<li>Tell the pseudo code to reverse a linked list.</li></li></ol><p>I started to make the logic for O (n) but he said it might not be possible to do it in 1 iteration so not an issue. But I gave him the logic of O (n) and 1 iteration.<ol start="3"><li>You have a matrix a[m] [n]. Transpose it into a matrix b[n] [m] in minimum iterations.

Gave cases for me to tell the error or right ans in abstract classes.<li>DBMS: 5th largest salary of employees from a given table. I answered using rownum and then limit but he wanted a general ans.

Min no. of runs reqd. to find the fastest horse.<p>\xe2\x80\x93 There are 4 people who want to cross a bridge. Minimum time they take to cross a bridge is 1, 2, 7 and 11 respectively. There is only 1 torch and at most 2 people can cross a bridge at a time. But no one can cross the bridge without torch (Someone has to come back to give the torch). Find minimum time in which all 4 cross the bridge.<p>2<sup>nd</sup> puzzle I 1<sup>st</sup> answered 22 but then corrected myself and answered 18 (1 and 2 cross. 1 comes back. 7 and 11 cross. 2 comes back. 1 and 2 cross \xe2\x80\x93 total time 2 + 1 + 11 + 2 + 2 = 18).<p>I was informed 5 minutes after my interview to be ready for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Round.<p><strong></strong><p><strong>Interview 2: Technical (20 mins)</strong><p>Was asked about self, my project on cloud computing and questions related to it.<p>1 technical question.<p>Write a code to delete x elements after 1st n elements.<p>I wrote the code but missed the case where n = 0. So as he was checking the code I told him the case I had missed. He was confused if the code would work if there were less than n + x elements but I showed him that it would.<p>Was a short interview compared to others and was scared of being rejected but finally was called for the hr interview in sometime.<p><strong>Interview 3: HR (20 mins)</strong><p>He first told me about the code I had written in the elimination round that it was the best code he got in the day.
