I was contacted by the HR asking me for my Resume. Next day she said she will be sharing an Online Assessment link.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 1:(Online Coding Round on Amcat Platform)</strong>\xc2\xa0<p>There were two coding questions need to be completed in 90 Min.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<ol><li>https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/542597/<li>https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/411357/</li></li></ol><p>https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/344650/Amazon-Online-Assessment-Questions/350386\xe2\x80\xb3&gt;<br/>After this round, All rounds were <strong>Virtual Onsite Interviews</strong> of 1 hr each held on video call through Amazon Chime.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 2:</strong>\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>This round started with the Interviewer\xe2\x80\x99s introduction and then my introduction. He then jumped to questions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/">Search an element in a sorted and\xc2\xa0rotated array</a></li></ol><p>I gave him the pivoted approach. He then asked me to code it on a live code share.\xc2\xa0<p>2. Follow-up question: He asked me to solve it in a single Binary Search without finding the pivot.\xc2\xa0<p>Then I gave him the Improved Solution and he asked me to code it.\xc2\xa0<p>3. Tell me about a project that you have completed in your current organization.\xc2\xa0<p>4. Behavioural question: Any situation when you had to cut corners to meet a deadline.\xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 3:</strong>\xc2\xa0<p>This round again started with the Interviewer\xe2\x80\x99s introduction and then my introduction. He then jumped to questions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-of-occurrences-or-frequency-in-a-sorted-array/">Count number of occurrences (or frequency) in a sorted array</a></li></ol><p>First I gave him the naive approach and then optimized to the best solution. He asked me to code it.\xc2\xa0<p>2. There are N bags, each having some no. of coins given by an array. We will be making K turns. In each turn, we have to select a bag and take out half coins from it (if coins=even, then coins/2 else coins/2+1). Return the maximum no. of coins that can be taken out in K turns.\xc2\xa0<p>Approach: Solved using Max Heap.\xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 4:(Hiring Manager)</strong>\xc2\xa0<p>This round again started with the Interviewer\xe2\x80\x99s introduction and then my introduction. He then asked me a lot of Behavioural questions related to the projects for the first 40 minutes. <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/437082/Amazon-Behavioral-questions-or-Leadership-Principles-or-LP#:~:text=Tell%20me%20about%20a%20time%20when%20you%20had%20to%20face,how%20did%20you%20resolve%20them%3F" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find some Amazon Behavioural Questions. Then he asked 2 coding questions:\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-subarrays-with-0-sum/">Print all subarrays with 0 sum</a></li></ol><p>We first discussed the approach and then he asked me to code it.\xc2\xa0<p>2. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-pairs-with-given-sum/">Print all pairs with given sum</a>\xc2\xa0<p>He wants me to discuss all the possible solutions (Naive, Sorting, Hashing) with their time complexities. Only the approach, no need to code.\xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 5:(Bar Raiser)</strong>\xc2\xa0<p>This round was taken by a Senior SDE having 10+ years of experience at Amazon. The round started with his introduction and then my introduction.\xc2\xa0<br/>\xc2\xa0<ol><li>Tell me about a project that you have completed in your current organization.<li>Some Behavioural questions related to the project.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transform-bst-sum-tree/">Transform a BST to greater sum tree</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-intersection-of-intervals-given-by-two-lists/">Find intersection of intervals given by two lists</a></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Verdict: Selected</strong><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
