The selection procedure involved a total of 5 rounds, at the end of which 5 candidates were selected.<p><strong>Round 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Online Coding Round</strong><br/>The first round consisted of 3 coding questions on Cocubes with a time limit of 75 minutes. Only the function body had to be coded.<ul><li>Given an array of n numbers, replace each element with it\xe2\x80\x99s farthest coprime in the range [2, 250]. Example, the farthest coprime for 2 is 249 and for 243 is 2.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/factorial-large-number/">Given a number n, return the factorial of the number as a string.</a> (The number was passed as an integer parameter and the string had to be returned.)<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-binary-tree-is-subtree-of-another-binary-tree/">Given two trees, tree A and tree B, return the size of the subtree if B is a subtree of A. Otherwise, return zero.</a></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Group fly</strong><br/>This was a written round with 2 questions.<ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-that-given-a-set-a-of-n-numbers-and-another-number-x-determines-whether-or-not-there-exist-two-elements-in-s-whose-sum-is-exactly-x/">Given a sorted integer array and a number X, find the number of unique pairs in the array that sum up to X.</a> (similar)<pre>Request format: "GET "\r\nResponse format: "DATA "</pre><p>Give test cases for the above request-response query.<br/>Example, a base case could be fetching data from a file on the server and comparing the data with the local copy of the same file.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Technical Interview \xe2\x80\x93 3 rounds</strong><p>My first round was a design round. I was given 3 scenarios.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li>Design a personal assistant like Cortana for your B.tech courses.<li>Given the heights and states of all the students in your college, what kind of analysis and grouping will you perform on the available data?<li>Consider a client-router-server network. Clients request for information from the server via the router. Every server has a backup in case it fails. How will you ensure data consistency after using the backup server when the main server fails?</li></li></li></ul><p><strong>My second round had 2 coding questions</strong><ul><li>Given a binary tree, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-level-order-traversal-line-line/">print it\xe2\x80\x99s level order traversal with each level on a different line</a>. Every line had to be prefixed with \xe2\x80\x9cLevel: (level number)\xe2\x80\x9d.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/">Given the root and two nodes of a binary tree, find the Least Common Ancestor (LCA) of the given nodes</a>. How will you modify the approach if every node has a parent pointer.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Last Round</strong><p>The last round had a very simple question. Given a string, report if the string contains all unique characters or not. We were asked to write industry level code and provide test cases as well.<p>I would like to thank <strong>geeksforgeeks.org</strong> for providing such exceptional placement support. I did all my preparation from the website alone.<br/>\xc2\xa0<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
