Some sets were easy and some were difficult. There are 3 coding questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>My set consisted of following questions<ol><li>Longest Common Prefix of all given strings<pre>       Input:{"geeksforgeeks", "geeks", "geek", "geezer"}\r\n       Output:"gee"\r\n       \r\n       Input:{"apple", "ape", "april"}\r\n       Output:"ap"</pre><li>\xc2\xa0Given an array and a number x. Find minimum length subarray whose sum is x.<pre>      Input:  A={1,2,3,4,5},x=3\r\n      Output: 1\r\n   There are 2 subarrays with sum 3 out of \r\n   which {3} is the smallest one.So output is 1</pre><li>\xc2\xa0 Given an array of strings and a string x.

After a quick introduction of both of us he straightaway gave me a coding question<ol><li>There are N days. Given the dates and temperatures on all the N days in form of a tuple sorted based on temperature. Find k closest dates to a given temperature from the tuple.</li></ol><p>I started solving and explained him a O(n) solution. After he seemed satisfied I told him the optimization involved and told him O(log n) solution using Binary Search. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 He asked me of several corner cases and verified code on all of them. Finally he seemed satisfied and he asked me for some questions. I asked him about the work \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0culture and profile he is currently in.<p>I was shortlisted for Round 2 within 5 min<p><strong>\xc2\xa0Interview Round 2: \xc2\xa0(64 min )</strong><p>There was only 1 interviewer which is held on MS teams.He asked me the famous problem of LRU Cache in a different way but finally it means the same.
