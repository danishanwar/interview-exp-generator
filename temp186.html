The process started with filling an application in Amazon WoW website, in the application basic info about college, branch, resume were to be submitted. After a few days based on the resume mail was sent regarding the round 1 test.<p>The test consisted of 28 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s (C++, data structures etc.) and 2 Medium level coding questions.<p>I was able to solve both the coding questions so I passed the round 1 test.<p><strong>Round 1 Technical interview:</strong><p>The interview was online and took place on Amazon Chime platform. The interview started with my introduction and followed by his. After this he jumped straight into the coding questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>I was asked 2 coding questions:<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-edges-required-to-make-a-directed-graph-strongly-connected/">Given a graph of n nodes and e edges.</a></li></ol><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-edges-required-to-make-a-directed-graph-strongly-connected/">\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Find the minimum number of edges that must be added to the graph to make it strongly connected.</a><p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<strong>Example:</strong><p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 n=4, e=2<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0[1,2]<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0[3,4]<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<strong> Output:</strong> 1<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Here 1\xe2\x80\x93&gt;2 and 3\xe2\x80\x93&gt;4 are connected to make it strongly connected we need to join either 1\xe2\x80\x93&gt;4 or 2\xe2\x80\x94&gt;4 or 3\xe2\x80\x93&gt;1 or 2\xe2\x80\x93&gt;3<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<strong>Approach:</strong> This can be done by finding number of strongly connected components using DFS.

He was satisfied with Hashing method.<p>Few DS, CN, OS questions were asked at the end.<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Selected<p>Knowing how to calculate time complexity is important. Staying confident, calm and focused throughout increases your chance of clearing the interview.<p>The secret of cracking an interview is <strong>Never Giving Up</strong>.<p>Practice from GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode and any other coding platform with which you are comfortable.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
