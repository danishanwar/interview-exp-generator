All the rounds were elimination rounds.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Technical Interview (Round 1):</strong><br/>It started with a detailed discussion about my projects.<br/>Then straight away jumped to problems.<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong><p>You are building a website in which users have to enter usernames. If username exists append a number in the following way and return the new username.<br/>Example:<br/>If first input is \xe2\x80\x9cabc\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cabc\xe2\x80\x9d itself should be returned as it isn\xe2\x80\x99t already existing<br/>If the next input is again \xe2\x80\x9cabc\xe2\x80\x9d, the string \xe2\x80\x9cabc0\xe2\x80\x9d has to be returned similarly you\xe2\x80\x99ve to append numbers in an increasing manner as mentioned, if username already exists.<br/>More examples,<p>If next input was \xe2\x80\x9cabcd\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cabcd\xe2\x80\x9d itself should be returned<br/>Followed by \xe2\x80\x9cabc\xe2\x80\x9d, output should be \xe2\x80\x9cabc1\xe2\x80\x9d (Because \xe2\x80\x9cabc\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabc0\xe2\x80\x9d, both were taken)<br/>And so on..<p>So given any input string give the output username.<p><strong>Solution:</strong><p>I suggested that it can be done using the Trie data structure. I was then asked to write the code on paper.<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong><br/>Given an array of N integers find the sum of all numbers whose number of set bits is at least two.<br/>Expected time complexity: O(N) strictly<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br/>Problem reduces down to finding the sum of numbers that are not an exact power of 2. Now to check if any number is an exact Power of 2 in constant time, bitwise operations can be used.<br/>For any number N, it is a perfect power of 2, if (N&amp;(N-1)) equals to 0.<p>I qualified and was called for the next round.<p><strong>Technical Interview (Round 2):</strong><br/>This was also a DSA round.<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong><p>This was the problem asked. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/vertical-sum/1">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vertical-sum-in-binary-tree-set-space-optimized/</a><p><strong>Problem 2:</strong><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/alien-dictionary/1">Alien Dictionary</a><p>Fully space optimized and time optimized codes were expected.<br/>Cleared the round.<p><strong>Technical Interview (Round 3):</strong><p>Again, another DSA round. Here are the problems.<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/0">LIS of array</a><p><strong>Problem 2:</strong><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/triplet-sum-in-array/0">Find number of Triplets with given sum</a><p><strong>Technical Interview + Hiring Manager (Round 4):</strong><p>This was a technical plus hiring manager round.<br/>The round started with a detailed discussion about my projects followed by 2 DSA questions:<br/>1. Code to check if I given linked list of characters is a palindrome or not (<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-linked-list-is-pallindrome/1">Link</a>)<br/>2. Given the cost of stocks on each day and you can buy and sell exactly one stock you have to maximize the profit. (<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-difference/0">Link</a>)<p>Later, I was asked questions like:<br/>Why Amazon, why should we hire you, will you be able to relocate, etc and also a small discussion about the <a href="https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/107288/controversy-erupts-as-ashwin-mankads-buttler">Ashwin-Buttler Incident</a> as it turned out that the interviewer was also a cricket follower \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p>Overall, I would like to say that the interviewers were really friendly and always provided hints when needed. It was more like a discussion rather than an \xe2\x80\x98interview\xe2\x80\x99. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate in asking hints, they\xe2\x80\x99re always there to help. All the best.<p>Finally, got the offer after a week. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
