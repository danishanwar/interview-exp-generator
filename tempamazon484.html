Since it was also a straight forward question. I explained two approaches and he was satisfied and asked me to code it.<p><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/segregate-even-and-odd-nodes-in-a-linked-list/0">Segregate even and odd elements in Linked list</a><p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article using <a href="http://www.contribute.geeksforgeeks.org">contribute.geeksforgeeks.org</a> or mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
