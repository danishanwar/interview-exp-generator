(No Heap solution)<li>There is a given data with time and number of orders at that time and it will random.

We need to find the longest chain. Eg: L1 = { 2,7,4,8,9,10}, L2 = {1,2,8,9,4}. Here the solution is 2 (chain is 2,4 or 8,9).

Then I suggested for the reversing of linked list and then adding the number. He was again asked me without reversing of linked list. Then I came up with the solution with linear search.<p>Thanks <strong>GeeksforGeeks</strong> for your work in helping so many programmers!!<p>\xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
