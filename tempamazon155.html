Then he directly jumps to coding questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/">Trapping Rainwater.</a> Firstly I gave him a brute force solution then the interviewer asked me to write an optimized solution.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/">Reverse a Linked list.</a></li></li></ol><p>This round went for around 1.25 hours and I solved both the questions.<p><strong>Third Round: </strong>After a formal introduction, the interviewer directly jumps to coding questions.<ol><li>Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.<li>The distance between two adjacent cells is 1. https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/</li></li></ol><p>At the end, the Interviewer asked some questions on Projects and this round went for around 65 minutes, and I was successful in solving this question with the optimized approach.<p><strong>Fourth Round (Technical + Behavioral): </strong>Started with an introduction and then moved on to a detailed discussion about the project.<ol><li>What was my role?<li>What Problems I had faced while making the project?</li></li></ol><p><strong>Behavioral Questions:</strong><ol><li>Tell me a situation where you worked on a tight deadline<li>Tell me a situation where you took a decision</li></li></ol><p>And then he asked me one coding question:<ol><li><p>Find the closest pair from two unsorted arrays having equal or unequal size.<p><strong>Question is similar to this: </strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-two-sorted-arrays-number-x-find-pair-whose-sum-closest-x/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-two-sorted-arrays-number-x-find-pair-whose-sum-closest-x/</a></p></p></li></ol><p>This round went for around 1 hour and for the behavioral questions you need to follow the STAR (S \xe2\x80\x93 situation, T \xe2\x80\x93 task, A \xe2\x80\x93 action, R \xe2\x80\x93 result) method.<p>Verdict: Selected \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p><strong>Tips:</strong><ol><li>For coding interviews, you will first need to explain your approach verbally and then if the interviewer is satisfied with the runtime complexity, he will ask you to write the code with proper syntax. You will not have to take input, just take the input as function parameters, and write the complete logic in the function). Practice explaining your approach.<li>For behavioral questions, find the set of questions https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/437631/Amazon-Leadership-Principle-(Behavioral)-Questions. Here is a nice simple blog explaining the process of behavioral interviews at amazon (https://interviewgenie.com/blog-1/interviewing-at-amazon-behavioral-interview-questions)<li>Make a list of tasks that you did<li>For every question try to fit those tasks into the situation<li>For every question be ready with at least two tasks.</li></li></li></li></li></ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
