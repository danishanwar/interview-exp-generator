The questions asked were how will you assign a player to another player who wants to play. You need to think about how to divide your players into multiple groups of ratings, so that a newbie is not playing a grand master, rather with someone who is of his level only. Then the question was how will you design your system when a player comes in and say I want to play, and the max wait time is 1 min, you need to find a player suitable for his level and think about multiple race conditions.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>This was DS round and I was asked two questions<p>Question1:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-row-with-maximum-number-1s/</a><p>Question 2:\xc2\xa0You are given 2 words with equal number of characters.
