I applied through the Career Site.<p><strong>Online Assessment round: </strong>2 coding questions were asked. (don\xe2\x80\x99t remember exactly), I have got an MD editor and also to explain my approach to questions and time complexities. You need to solve both questions to get a call for an interview.<p><strong>Round -1 (Coding round): </strong>Around 3 weeks later, I received a call from the recruiter that I have 2 interview rounds in the next week on the same day. This round was taken by a senior SDE-2. We introduced ourselves and then he directly jumped into coding questions.<ol><li>Move zeros to last (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-zeroes-end-array/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-zeroes-end-array/</a>)<li>Remove k consecutive chars (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reduce-the-string-by-removing-k-consecutive-identical-characters/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reduce-the-string-by-removing-k-consecutive-identical-characters/</a>)</li></li></ol><p>We first discussed the approaches to solve the problems and then when I reached the optimized solution to the problem. He asked me to write the code and discussed the space and time complexities.<p><strong>Round \xe2\x80\x93 2 (Coding round): </strong>After one hour on the same day, I had the next round of interviews. It was taken by two senior SDE-1. They asked me to introduce myself.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>I didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly remember the question but it was an application-based modified DFS of graph problem.<li>Count ways to reach nth stairs. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-ways-reach-nth-stair/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-ways-reach-nth-stair/</a>)</li></li></ol><p>I have explained both the question in 45 minutes. They asked me if I have any questions for them. I have asked them to tell me their experience.<p>After around a week later, I received a call that I have the next round of interviews on the next day.<p><strong>Round \xe2\x80\x93 3 (Bar-raiser round): </strong>This round is taken by a senior manager. We faced a lot of bandwidth issues from his side.<ol><li>He asked me about my recent projects. The approach, the challenges I faced, and their solutions.<li>He asked me some behavioral questions too like Tell me about a time you made a blunder (Technical and personal both).<li>He also asked me what are questions asked in my previous rounds. and then gave me this problem.<li>Reverse zig-zag tree traversal. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/zigzag-tree-traversal/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/zigzag-tree-traversal/</a>)</li></li></li></li></ol><p>This round didn\xe2\x80\x99t go so well. I was nervous about the next round. The gap between this round and the next round was 15 minutes but this round lasted 10 minutes longer. So, I got only 5 minutes between both rounds.<p><strong>Round \xe2\x80\x93 4 (Bar-raiser round): </strong>This round was also taken by a senior manager having about twelve years of experience. We started with the Introduction.<ol><li>This was similar to the questions asked in the previous round. He asked me about my recent projects. The approach, the challenges I faced, and their solutions. This time he went in-depth.<li>Also some HR questions, Why do you want to leave your current company?<li>Why Amazon?<li>Maximum sum path (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-path-sum-in-a-binary-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-path-sum-in-a-binary-tree/</a>)</li></li></li></li></ol><p>A week later I received a call that I got selected.\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
