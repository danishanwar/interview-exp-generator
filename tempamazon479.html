He asked for more optimisation (avoid extra space) but in given time I could not find solution without extra space.<li>Find the difference between sum of values in odd level and sum of values in even level in given binary tree: I explained the approach then he asked me to write code with both recursive and non-recursive approach.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/odd-even-level-difference/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2 (50 Mins)</strong><ol><li>Tapping Rain Water problem: I didnt know the classic solution but I came up with my own approach which worked fine.<p><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/trapping-rain-water/0">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>A 2d array with all 1s and 0s where 1s are land and 0s are water, Matrix itself is surrounded with water i.e 0.
