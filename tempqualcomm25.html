The boxes have been incorrectly labelled such that no label identifies the actual contents of the box it labels. Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>Then he asked me to ask any questions if I had. I asked a few.<p><em>Second Technical round:\xc2\xa0</em>He asked some questions from my resume. He then asked me to explain one of my Machine Learning projects.<ol><li>Different System calls and why do we use them.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-introduction-system-call/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-introduction-system-call/</a><li>Difference between Kernel and Operating System.<li>Different phases of Compiler and in-detail explanation of each of the phases.<li>How compiler does intermediate code optimization?<li>What are <em>Static</em> and <em>Dynamic</em> Libraries?<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-vs-dynamic-libraries/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-vs-dynamic-libraries/</a><li>Why do we use Cache Memory?<li>What is Cache Coherence Protocol and when do we use them.<li>Difference between <em>Scheduler</em> and <em>Dispatcher</em>.<li>What are the applications of <em>Unions?</em> and problem-related to U<em>nions</em>.<li>How to detect and remove the loop from the Linked List.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3: </strong>This\xc2\xa0was HR round.
