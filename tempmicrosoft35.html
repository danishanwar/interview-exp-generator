Because of the increase in cloud adaption, there is a need for reliable ETL tools in the cloud to make the integration. The Azure data factory stands out when compared to other ETL tools because of <strong>features</strong> such as <strong>Easy to Use, </strong>Cost-Effective<strong> solution ,</strong> <strong>Powerful and intelligent code free service.</strong><h3>The architecture<strong> of Azure data Factory:</strong></h3><p>The figure below describes the Architecture of the data engineering flow using the Azure data factory<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width:810px"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-640982" height="411" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20210708161550/r11.png" srcset="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20210708161550/r11.png 1000w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20210708161550/r11-300x123.png 300w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20210708161550/r11-768x316.png 768w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20210708161550/r11-660x271.png 660w" width="1000"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Azure data Factory</p></div><p>The various components of the Azure data factory are as follows:<ol><li>Activities<li>Pipelines<li>Linked Services<li>Datasets<li>Data Flows<li>Integration Runtimes</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>All these components work together in runtime to help extract and transform the source data.<p>Before understanding what a pipeline is it is necessary to understand what an activity is.\xc2\xa0<ul><li><strong>Activity : </strong>Activities in a pipeline define actions to perform on data. For example, copy data activity can read from one location of Blob storage and loads it to another location on Blob storage<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Pipeline : </strong>Pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that together perform a task. For example, Pipeline can have a set of activities that take data from ADLS and perform some transformation of data using U-SQL and load data in SQL DB\xc2\xa0<li><strong>Linked Services: </strong>Linked services are used to connect to other sources with the Azure data factory. Linked services act as connection strings for resources to connect. For example, Connecting an AWS S3 to the Azure Data Factory<li><strong>Datasets: </strong>Datasets are simply points or reference the data, which we want to use in our activities as input or output<li><strong>Dataflows: </strong>Data flows feature in the Azure data factory will allow users to develop graphical data transformation logic that can be executed as activities in ADF pipelines<li><strong>Integration Runtimes:</strong> The Integration Runtime(IR) is to compute infrastructure used by ADF to provide capabilities such as \xc2\xa0Data Flow, Data Movement, Activity Dispatch, and SSIS Package Execution across different network environments.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><h3><strong>Pricing Of Azure Data Factory:</strong></h3><ul><li>No upfront cost<li>No termination fees<li>Pay only for what you use</li></li></li></ul><ol><li><strong>Data Pipelines:</strong> Helps to Integrate data from cloud and hybrid data sources, at scale. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 Pricing starts from \xe2\x82\xb972.046 / 1,000 activity runs per month<li><strong>SQL Server Integration Services:\xc2\xa0</strong> Helps to easily move your existing on-premises SQL Server Integration Services projects to a fully-managed environment in the cloud. -Pricing for SQL Server Integration Services integration runtime nodes start from \xe2\x82\xb960.498 /hour</li></li></ol><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
