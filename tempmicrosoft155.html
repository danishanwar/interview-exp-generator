I talked to the recruiter over the phone, and scheduled a phone screen with a Principle Software Engineer.<p><strong>Phone screen:</strong><ol>Since it was over the phone, it was a little hard hearing and understanding what the other person was saying. But they asked some basic questions at first like what do I do, and they were looking for how well I can explain technical stuff.</ol></p><li>I explained over the phone a cool project I was working on at work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on a lot of projects, but I picked the most interesting one. The interviewer didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my latest project because the one I was talking about was actually a lot more interesting.<li>Then the interviewer asked me a technical question: Given requests at random times, return the requests from the last 1 minute. It was a little more detailed than that, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to finish the question, but somehow I was still able to be called onto the on-site interview.<p><strong>On-site interview:</strong><br/>I walked in and there were about 12 other people being interviewed as well. They put us in a separate conference room and then we had 4 rounds of interviews after that. Each 45 minutes, and then one 15 minute break. Total 4 hours.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>First round:</strong><ol>Asked basic questions.</ol></p><li>Then asked a question where given brackets, parenthesis, and/or curly braces, see if it is valid. Like {]}{})(, {}()[()]. The first one would be false, the second one would be true. The interviewer really looked for when I would get stuck, and tried to see how I would react when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know something. He liked the part when I got stuck, and when I was able to find my way back to the solution.<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-for-balanced-parentheses-in-an-expression/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><p><strong>Second round:</strong><ol>This round the guy was a bit unconventional. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he asked me a single basic question to start the conversation. He walked in, asked me to code some problems, and then left. Barely any words at all besides technical question clarifications.</ol></p><li>But the questions he asked was if A=1, B=2, C=3, \xe2\x80\xa6, then write a function to return the number corresponding to the string. Z would be 26, then it would be AA, which would be 27. What would BB be, or ABC, or ABB, etc.<p><strong>Third round:</strong><ol><li>This was the design question. The question was design tinyURL.<li>Also was asked<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/"> remove duplicates from a linked list.</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>Fourth round:</strong><ol>This was the toughest. I think he was the main engineer to impress.</ol></p><li>He asked given a sentence \xe2\x80\x9chow are you\xe2\x80\x9d, reverse the words and return \xe2\x80\x9cyou are how\xe2\x80\x9d. I could not use splitBy(), and I had to also not use any data structures. I was able to solve it in optimal time, but I ended up needing a data structure. But there was a way to not use data structures actually.<br/><b>Solution</b> :<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><p>After that I just went home. I felt really good about the interview, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything for a while. Then they called me late next week and told me I had multiple teams interested in hiring me for multiple positions. Then I had to pick which one I wanted. I ended up picking Azure AD as a Software Engineer. This was probably the happiest day of my life \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
