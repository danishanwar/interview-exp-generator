The process took 1 whole day. I interviewed at Amazon (New Delhi) in September 2018.<p><strong>Round 1:</strong><ol>First they took Online round on AMCAT platform, having majorly 4 sections.</ol></p><li>Debugging<li>Reasoning and Aptitude<li>Coding Round(2 questions)<li>Personality Test<p>All sections had to be done in that particular sequence only and you cannot jump in between sections. Also if one completes the round before the stipulated time then remaining time will NOT be added into next round.<p>On basis of this round they shortlisted about 35 students and called them for personal interviews.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol>In this interview for first 20-25 mins, interviewer discussed about my Machine Learning Project and asked me all the questions related to my project.You just need to be cool and calm and always listen carefully to the questions asked by the interviewer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t panic and do not stammer, it gives a negative impact on the interviewer.<p>Then he asked me a coding question on Binary Search Trees.</p><li><strong>Coding Question</strong> \xe2\x80\x93<p>Given two Arryas and you need to form BST from them respectively. Find whether <strong>the structure</strong> <strong><em>and</em> values</strong> at corresponding places are same or not i.e, whether two BST are same or not.(Assuming first element is always the root)<p>Eg. Array [5, 3, 6] and Array [5, 6, 3] will give you same BST <strong>BUT</strong> Array [5, 2, 3, 6] and Array [5, 3, 2, 6] wont give you same BST.<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/determine-if-two-trees-are-identical/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><p>I solved the problem and he checked the solution and gave me some edge cases for it. Also he asked me to code the whole solution on paper. I solved the question on paper and he checked the code and was pretty satisfied with the code and its complexity( O(n) ).<p>He asked me whether I have any question for him and I asked all usual questions.</p></p></p></p></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>The TnP cell told me that I have no further rounds and hence I can leave. They said they will mail the results to the successful candidates.<p>VERDICT: <strong>G<em>ot The Offer.</em></strong><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
