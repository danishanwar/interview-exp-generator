I had to join every rope to get a final rope of length L1 + L2 + \xe2\x80\xa6 + LN.</a><br/>However, I can join only two ropes at a time and the cost of joining the two ropes is L1 + L2.

Both linked lists have a single-digit number in their nodes.</a> I needed to<br/>treat this linked lists as a numbers and add them up and store the digits in a new linked list.<br/>E.g., head -&gt; 5 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 7-&gt; 9<br/>head -&gt; 2-&gt; 1 -&gt; 1<br/>Resultant linked list: head-&gt; 5 -&gt; 8-&gt; 9-&gt; 0 (5679 + 211 = 5890)<p><strong>Round 3: Hiring Manager round</strong><br/>Q-5 Project discussion in detail.
