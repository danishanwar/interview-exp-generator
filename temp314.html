Interviewer was satisfied with my approach.She said write code on paper.<p>2.Find the intresection point in linked list direct from gfg .I told solution and she was satisfied.<p>3.It was related to min heap and write code on paper.I told solution and she was satisfied and said that we will come back for next round.<p><strong>Round 4:</strong>He asked me three problem<p>1.Find Majority element in an array.I first told take map then he said extra space is not allowed.I gave second approach using sorting but he said do in o(n).Then I come up with efficient solution in o(n) .He was satisfied and said Nice.But he asked, have you done it before? i said yes i have done it before 2-3 month then he was happy.<p>2.related to binary tree find maximum sum path i have done it using recursion.<p>3.circular patrol pump i told approach and then he said ok.<p>After this he discussed on dbms and operating system related to deadlock, semaphore, mutex, critical section, ACID property.etc.<p><strong>Round 5:</strong>4 student were select for this round.It was HR round in this he asked some question related to project and then asked np-complete problem, max heapify code, scc(strongly connected component).<p>The result was announced after some discussion only one from us selected Unfortunately i was not that one.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
