The coding problems were:<ul><li>Rotate a matrix by 90 degrees.<li>Longest increasing subsequence.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Technical 1, he asked me two questions:<ul><li>If a number is written on a paper and that paper is rotated by 180 degrees, will the number remain the same?<li>Merge two sorted arrays to get a resultant sorted array. Sub questions were to get the resultant array into increasing as well as decreasing order.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Technical 2, he also gave me two questions. He first asked me about my strong areas. I accidentally told him my weak areas too. That was my blunder. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever do that.<ul><li>If there are files that are dependent on each other and I need to compile them. In what order should they be executed that all of them would get successfully compiled? This was basically topological sort.<li>2x+3y+7z = n \xe2\x80\x93&gt; Find all possible combinations of x, y, z such that they satisfy above equation. I had suggested two approaches but he wanted the solution of lesser complexity. The optimized solution is obtained by dynamic programming. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer it using DP.</li></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
