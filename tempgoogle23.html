For this round, we were guided for two weeks by the WE program mentors. They conducted sessions to teach us the basics of programming and cleared our doubts in the doubts sessions. We were also provided the study material &amp; recorded video lectures to prepare well for the coding round. We had a choice to choose the programming language in which we want to write the Coding test. The test included questions to examine our programming skills. The questions required a thorough understanding of the concepts and revolved around predicting the output of a code snippet and writing codes for the given problem statements.
