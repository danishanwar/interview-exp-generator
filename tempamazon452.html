If a product is viewed multiple times by a single customer its view count is increased only by 1. The number of products is very large so sorting, heap or hashing of product Ids is not feasible.<p><strong>Solution</strong>\xe2\x80\x93 Use Trie data structure. After 10 minutes of discussion, I could come up this.<br/>Production level code for insert and search in a trie was required.<p>What if k max viewed products were required.<br/>During my discussion, he also asked me to write a hashing function.</p></p></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2:</strong><ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dfs of a graph.</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dfs-n-ary-tree-acyclic-graph-represented-adjacency-list/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dfs of a n array tree.

This continued for 10 min.<li>Given a m*n matrix find the number of paths from (0,0) to (m-1,n-1), at every block we either move 1 step down or 1 step right. Print all paths for the above question.
