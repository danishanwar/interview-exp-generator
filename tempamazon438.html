MCQ had more networking and DS problems.<ol><li>Given three linked list, add them. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><p>Input will be of this format<pre>1-&gt;0-&gt;1\r\n8-&gt;9-&gt;9\r\n5\r\nOutput: 1-&gt;0-&gt;0-&gt;5\r\n</pre><p>Solving above problem in python is easier than C++. I solved it in C++ using deque(30/30 points).<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/three-great-candidates/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of size n consisting of positive integers, choose three integers(not necessarily contiguous) such that they are in ascending order and their product is maximum.</a> Input was given in this format.<pre>\r\narray = {5, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10}\r\nOutput: array = {8, 9, 10}\r\n</pre><p>Many people(including me) ignored the ascending order part and got 20/30 points. Later during interview, interviewer asked me to explain my code and told me the corner case.<p>Note: Input was given exactly like I said in both problems. It was a bit different from usual problems. You first have to break strings to integers then solve the problem.</p></p></li></p></p></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2:</strong><ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/tic-tac-toe/0\'">Tic-Tac-Toe</a><p>This was on paper round. I have heard there is another easier solution using magic square. 8 were selected from this round.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3:</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Technical Interview Round 1<p>The interview started with the most common questions \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cProjects/Internship\xe2\x80\x9d. Then there were few theory questions like what is binary tree? What is binary search tree? Then 2 coding questions.<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/level-order-traversal/1">Level order traversal</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-permutation/0">Find next greater number with same set of digits</a><p>Instead of digits, it was string of alphabets. There was a bug in my code. Interviewer gave me a test case and asked me to test it. Changed the approach and solved it by sorting. He asked which sorting and why? First I said merge sort because of nlogn complexity. Then I said since range is small(1-26), we can use count sort. He asked if we really need sorting? Then I said that reversing the second part was sufficient because it was in descending order.</p></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4:<br/></strong><p>Technical Interview Round 2<p>Again discussion on \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cProjects/Internship\xe2\x80\x9d.<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/0">Maximum of all subarrays of size k</a></li></ol><p>He first asked how will you solve this problem. Gave 3 different approaches. Then finally asked to write code for deque approach.<p>I was asked few more theory questions from DS and DAA. Like what are some algorithmic paradigm? Difference between Greedy and DP? Questions on Dijkstra(Complexity, greedy or dp). And finally I was given a problem based on graph and was asked which algorithmic paradigm will be used to solve it? Answer was backtracking.<p>Interviewers were friendly. They helped us giving hints wherever we got stuck.<p>My advice is read past interview experiences from GeeksforGeeks and practice those problems on\xc2\xa0<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks judge</a>. Brush up your CS fundamentals like Data structures, Algorithms, Networking and Database.<p>Thank you GeeksforGeeks for helping me during my interview preparation. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<div id="practiceCompanyLinkDiv"><div style="font-size:16px;color:#404040;font-weight:700"><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/company/Amazon/">All Practice Problems for Amazon</a> !</div><p></p></div><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
