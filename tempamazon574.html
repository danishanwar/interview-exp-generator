The process was :<p>Online Round :<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94-<br/>A hackkerank contest with 22 questions inclusive of 2 coding problems and 20 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s on OS,Aptitude,DBMS .<p>Coding Questions :<br/>1. Given a 2d array with only elements \xe2\x80\x98#\xe2\x80\x99 &amp; \xe2\x80\x98.\xe2\x80\x99 . \xe2\x80\x98#\xe2\x80\x99 represents cherry and \xe2\x80\x98.\xe2\x80\x99 represents nothing . Can you divide the array into 2 halves with equal cherries . You could only make a single cut either horizontal or vertical .<p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sliding Window of size k . Find max of each window.</a><p>Round 1 :<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94<br/>Problem 1: Search in rotated and sorted array .<br/>Interviewer wants all corner cases covered code .And also Max optimized time complexity .<br/>I gave a O(2*logn) solution he got satisfied .<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Problem 2:<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/ways-to-sum-to-n/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given a number k , Find no. of ways to make this number using sum of numbers from 1 to k-1 </a>. Also You cannot take same number more than once in a combination and also all permutations of a combination count as one way .<p>For eg: if k= 6, Then all permuations of (1,2,3) count as one way only.<br/>I got shortlisted after this round .<p>Round 2<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94-<br/>It consists of a single problem only but a detailed discussion on that .<p>Problem : Range Minimum Query .i.e Given an array and a range query (xi,yi) find min element in the range (xi,yi) . These queries can be very large .<p>First i gave bruteforce approach and after that I gave a segment Tree solution to that with time and space complexity .<p>He then asked what if we have to update an element and then followed by updating a range .<p>After that he asked what if we delete an element . How do you modify your solution to cope-up with that .<br/>I suggested him to update the element with INT_MAX and maintain a mapping array .<br/>After that he asked what if we add an element in the array ? .<br/>I suggested him to reconstruct segment tree based on that . He suggested to construct it like a binary root instead of array representation and store the range . There can be some re-usable subtrees . How can i found those subtrees and how to use them and what will be the time complexities.<p>Lastly i was told to code range minmium query with node having following properties (min,start,end,node* left,node* end ) ;<p>He got impressed .:)<p>Round 3<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x93<p>It also consist of only a single problem .<br/>Problem : Given set of coordinates find top k elements whose distance from origin in maximum .<p>I gave naive approaches and heap approach . Later he asked me to think more then i come up with Quick-Sort Partition function approach .<br/>He asked me to code it .<p>Round 4<br/>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94<br/>It was easiest of all so far .<br/>It consist of problem : Given 2 linked list subtract them and store the result in bigger one and return that .<br/>Basically he wants us to cover all corner cases for this .<p>After that a discussion on projects took place.<p>Thanks Geeks For geeks for huge programming problems database .
