The most difficult part was the output based question. I was lucky enough to clear the online round.<p>Then I had 4 rounds of interviews that were conducted through Amazon Chime. Each interview was about 1hour except the 3rd one, it lasted for about 1hr 30 minutes.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 1 (Coding 1): </strong>It started with the introduction of the interviewer and then mine. He then directly jumped to coding questions<p><strong>Questions asked were:</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-characters-string-no-two-adjacent/" target="_blank">Rearrange characters in a string such that no two adjacent are same</a><li>Given 2 strings of numbers, I was asked to add them.</li></li></ol><p>With this, my first round ended.<p><strong>Round 2 (Coding 2): </strong>After introducing himself, he directly jumped to the coding question<ol><li style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/path-rectangle-containing-circles/" target="_blank">Path in a Rectangle with Circles </a>I was required to print the path.</li></ol><p>The interviewer then asked me to make the code easier to understand by using structures. With this, the interview ended.<p><strong>Round 3 (Tech): </strong>This round started after the introduction. The interviewer jumped to coding questions.<ol><li style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/box-stacking-problem-dp-22/" target="_blank">Box Stacking Problem</a> (But there was an assumption that we have the only box of each dimension.)<li>A person is standing at floor \xe2\x80\x98A\xe2\x80\x99 and wants to go floor \xe2\x80\x98B\xe2\x80\x99 using a lift. A lift can either go x floors up and y floors down. I was supposed to tell the minimum number of steps.</li></li></ol><p>After thinking, I reached a solution using BFS and the interviewer was satisfied.<p>The interviewer then asked some basic computer fundamental questions:<ul><li>Features of oops<li>Where we should not use the concept of oops<li>Deadlock and its conditions and its avoidance<li>OSI layer which among these layers is most important according to me<li>Difference b between SQL and no-SQL</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>With this my 3rd round ended.<p><strong>Round 4 (Technical+HR): </strong>The interview begins with the introduction of the interviewer and the mine. The interviewer asked me about my projects.<p>Then asked some HR questions like:<ul><li>The technical problem you faced during any of your projects<li>Anything you learned on your own</li></li></ul><p>Then the interviewer asked questions related to CS fundamental<ul><li>What happens when we type www.amazon.com basically he was asking about DNS<li>Deadlock and its conditions<li>OOPs and its features \xc2\xa0I explained using real-life examples<li>No-sql<li>ACID properties</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>Then he asked me one coding question\xc2\xa0<ol><li style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/" target="_blank">Reverse words in a given string</a></li></ol><p>But here the string was in form of linked list like:\xc2\xa0<pre>g-&gt;e-&gt;e-&gt;k-&gt;s-&gt;\'  \'-&gt;f-&gt;o-&gt;r-&gt;\'  \'-&gt;g-&gt;e-&gt;e-&gt;k-&gt;s</pre><p>I used the same i.e. reversed the entire linked list and the reversed words using the approach same as <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/" target="_blank">Reverse a Linked List in groups of given size</a> with this my 4th round ended. After 2 days, I got the result and I am offered FTE + 6 months internship.<p><strong>Tips:</strong><ul><li>Be loud while thinking so that interviewer could come to know your thought process.<li>Don\xe2\x80\x99t give up coding questions, keep on discussing it with the interviewer and you will reach to the approach.<li>Be confident<li>Practice questions from GeeksforGeeks and leetcode.<li>Should be able to calculate space and time complexities.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
