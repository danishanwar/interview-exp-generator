If there are more than x requests,what will you do?<br/>We want a continuous flow. How will you do that?<p><strong>2.</strong> Suppose in a system, some processes are already running. Now when an user will give new task(or process), he will give a list of processes his process is dependent upon. Some of those may be running, some may not be running right now. You have to ensure that there is no contention, i.e., If a process, Pj is dependent on process Pi,<br/>Pj should not execute along with Pi. How will you ensure that? Complete algorithm with code was required. The interviewer went on complicating the problem.<br/>At last I used graph and 3 hashmaps to solve the problem. He was ok with it.<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s it.
