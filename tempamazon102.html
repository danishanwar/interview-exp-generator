I was asked two questions.\xc2\xa0<ol><li>The first question was finding sliding window maximum. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k3101/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k3101/1</a><li>The second one was to find the distance between two nodes of the Binary tree. ht<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/min-distance-between-two-given-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/min-distance-between-two-given-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/1</a></li></li></ol><p>Then the interviewer slightly modified the question \xe2\x80\x93 what if the node structure of that binary tree defines \xe2\x80\x93 value, parent. Given the two nodes. Find the distance between them.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> This round was also a technical round wherein I was asked two coding problems.<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-largest-elements3736/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-largest-elements3736/1</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/excel-sheet5448/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/excel-sheet5448/1</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3:</strong> This was the last round. We had a discussion related to my internships and projects. Then he asked me a couple of behavioral questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Then he asked me DP problem. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence-1587115620/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence-1587115620/1</a></li></ol><p>The interviewers were very friendly. Overall the level was medium. One needs to be very calm during solving the problems. Be very clear about the time and space complexities and always speak while you are thinking. Discuss your solution with the interviewer and then only move onto writing the code. Always ask your interviewer if you are stuck or if you have any doubts.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Selected<p>GeeksforGeeks is a great place to learn Data structures and Algorithms, which is the most important part of the interviews.<p>All the best!<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
