Here is my interview experience for internship at Amazon.<br/>Position: 2-Month Intern<br/>No. of Rounds: 1 Online + 2 PI (2 F2F)<p><strong>Round 1: (90 minutes)</strong><br/>20 MCQs and 2 coding questions<br/>There were 20 MCQs based on C output, probability, basic maths, OOPS, algorithm analysis and Operating Systems.<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-linked-list-in-groups-of-given-size/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes</a> (where k is an input to the function).<br/>Example:<br/>Inputs: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL and k = 3<br/>Output: 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;NULL.<br/>Inputs: 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8-&gt;NULL and k = 5<br/>Output: 5-&gt;4-&gt;3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;8-&gt;7-&gt;6-&gt;NULL.<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-first-letter-of-every-word-in-the-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a string containing words separated by arbitrary number of spaces. Write a function that returns a string consisting of the first letter of each word.</a> (Note: there may be any number of spaces at the starting of the given string, at the end of the given string or in between words of the string.)<br/>Example:<br/>Input: \xe2\x80\x9d this is a test case \xe2\x80\x9d<br/>Output: tiatc<br/>(Function prototypes and main was given for both the questions. Although many solutions passed the initial test cases, they were rejected later as they did not satisfy boundary cases.)<p><strong>Round 2: (face to face) (1 hour 20 min)</strong><br/><strong>Question 1:</strong> <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given two numbers represented by two linked lists, write a function that returns sum list.</a> The sum list is linked list representation of addition of two input numbers.<br/>Example<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><pre>Input:\r\n First List: 5-&gt;6-&gt;3  // represents number 563\r\n Second List: 8-&gt;4-&gt;2 //  represents number 842\r\nOutput\r\n Resultant list: 1-&gt;4-&gt;0-&gt;5  // represents number 1405</pre><p>I reversed the linked lists and simply added the corresponding nodes along with the carry. Then he asked me to solve the question without reversing the list. Then I solved the question iteratively without reversing the lists.<br/>The interviewer then asked me to write a recursive code for the same problem.<br/>After that he asked me to modify the code so that the carry at each place is passed by value instead of using pointers(which I had used in my code).<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> iterative and recursive code to <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reverse a linked list</a>(Take Care of corner cases: when list has no nodes or contains a single node)<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-if-subtree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Write a function to check whether a binary tree is a sub-tree of another binary tree</a> (Check for all corner cases).<br/>I solved it in O(n^2) time complexity. He did not ask me to optimize my code.<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Which data structure would you use to keep records of stock market?<p>I asked him to clarify the problem statement.<p>He then asked me : Suppose you have to maintain the stock values of various companies during various periods and return minimum stock value of a particular company over a given period of time.<p>I answered segment tree (Probably the correct answer was queue data structure).<br/>However the interviewer proceeded with questions on segment tree.<br/>He asked me to write a code for<br/><strong>a)</strong> Creating a segment tree<br/><strong>b)</strong> Performing range minimum query in a segment tree<br/><strong>c)</strong> Updating the segment tree<br/>He asked me to analyze the time complexity for building the segment tree and performing the range minimum query in the segment tree.<br/>He then asked me: If you are to maintain the stock value of a company for the past 6 months..then you have to update the segment tree every day by deleting a stock value and inserting a new stock value. How would you do that?<br/>Here I got stuck and could not perform the updation in better than O(n) time.(However using queue it can be performed in O(1) time) .<p>He finally asked me if I had any questions.<p><strong>Round 3: (face to face) (20 min)</strong><br/>Only one technical question was asked to me in this round.<p><strong>a)</strong> He asked me to speak something about myself and my technical achievements..<p><strong>b)</strong> How to store a binary tree in a file &amp; then read back.(It is not necessarily a BST)<br/>First I answered that I would store level-order traversal of the tree.<br/>He then asked me how I would maintain the nodes at various levels (which I was unable to answer). So, I changed my approach and told that: I would store in-order and pre-order traversals of the tree from which the original tree can be easily retrieved.<br/>But then he told me to optimize my approach (As this approach would require twice the original space to store the data in the nodes). I could not further optimize my approach (However the better approach was to use parenthesization.<pre>\r\n                                    A\r\n                                      /   \\\r\n                                        B    C\r\n                                        /   \\\r\n                             D      E</pre><p>If this is the binary tree then it can be stored as (A(B(D),(E)),(C)) in the file.)<br/><strong>c) </strong>Then there was a 10 min discussion my project , the problems I encountered and how I solved them.<br/><strong>d) </strong>Finally he asked me if I had any questions.<br/>I asked about the intern projects at Amazon and the use of DBMS and NETWORKING in it.<br/>He started elaborating the entire work-process at Amazon and his work-experience\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6..most of which I could hardly understand. He also told me to have a good knowledge of JAVA as it will be required at some stage during the projects.<p>Finally I got selected.<p>Many Many congratulations to the author.
