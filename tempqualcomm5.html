Each section had 20 questions and 30 minutes to solve. +1 if you give the correct answer and -0.25 for every wrong answer.<p><strong>Section 1(Quantitative Aptitude and Logical Reasoning): </strong>https://www.tutorialspoint.com/quantitative_aptitude/aptitude_number_system_quiz.htm. Apart from this, you should have practice solving roadmap puzzle questions where some data is given and you have answer 4-5 questions based on this data interpretation.<p><strong>Section 2(Programming related MCQs): </strong>This section had questions from OS, C programming, find Output, error prediction (if any), memory allocation, bit manipulation, and DSA(trees). No OOPs and DBMS questions were asked.<p><strong>Section 3(Communication/Data Interpretation/Digital): </strong>We had to choose one among these three sections. As I had applied for a software role, I chose communication. It will test your vocabulary, grammar, passage-based questions, sentence order.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>I cleared this test and got shortlisted for the interview round.<p><strong>Round 2(Online Interview): </strong>My interview was taken over MS Teams video meet and lasted for about 45 minutes. The interview began with exchanging greetings and the following were these questions:<ol><li>Tell me about yourself \xe2\x80\x93 You may fumble but it\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Gather courage and complete your introduction. \xc2\xa0Believe me, after this the ice really breaks and you are good to proceed with technical questions. The interviewer won\xe2\x80\x99t judge you on this. This question is asked to make you more comfortable. Tell me about your hobbies, interests. In my case, one of my interests matched that of the interviewer. This made me much more confident. Be confident throughout and always have that smile on your face. Most of the time, the interviewers are very friendly and helpful. Ask for hints or problem clarification. Go with the mindset of discussing problems rather than merely coding them.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1">Find missing numbers from 1 to N\xc2\xa0</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/element-appearing-once2552/1">Find non-repeating element</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-integer-overflow-multiplication/">Check for integer overflow</a><li>Calculate memory used in union{ int i; char c[4]; }x; and struct x { int i; char c[4]; };<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/key-pair5616/1">Find Pair with given sum</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/swap-all-odd-and-even-bits-1587115621/1">Swap even and odd bits</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strassens-matrix-multiplication/">Matrix multiplication\xc2\xa0</a><li>Any questions for me \xe2\x80\x93 I asked about what my role would be with Qualcomm.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>The interviewer expected me to provide the exact solution which is given in the GfG articles and I could tell the correct approach. My interviewer did not want me to write code but to tell the exact optimized approach to solve the problem. Also, the interviewer expected me to have sound knowledge of bit manipulation and digital design fundamentals. The interviewer was very helpful and friendly and provided me hints too wherever necessary.<p>This was the only technical round and I got selected at the end.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
