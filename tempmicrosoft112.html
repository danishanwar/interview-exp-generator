The time complexity should be mentioned and sample test case had to be written and run on the code.I was able to solve 1 question but followed all the rules above and was selected.20 students were shortlisted for the next round.<p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>It was a technical interview where 2 questions were asked :-<ol><li>Given a string identify if its a valid IP address.You can find this question <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-validate-an-ip-address/">here</a> .<li>Given 2 positions in matrix find whether path exists between them.You can find this question <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-whether-path-two-cells-matrix/">here</a>\xc2\xa0.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4:</strong><p>It was a technical interview where I was asked to implement a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sudoku-backtracking-7/">Sudoku-Solver</a> and calculate time complexity of the Backtracking approach.In case of interviews, keep telling the interviewers your approach as you formulate your solution.Write code in a neat way and if you identify a mistake in your code then tell the interviewer and correct it.11 students were shortlisted for the next round including me.<p><strong>Round 5:</strong><p>This was a HR round in which questions were asked from the resum\xc3\xa8.I had to explain all the projects that I did and asked him of the projects being done at Microsoft. The interview was very general with no technical questions asked.<p>Finally, 5 students were shortlisted for the internship on the basis of last 3 rounds.I was also selected.I would like to thank GFG for my success and would request aspirants to regularly do GFG practice in order to get internship at companies like Microsoft.<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
