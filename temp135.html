(<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/total-decoding-messages1235/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/total-decoding-messages1235/1</a>)<li>Given Equation for num1, num2, and X in the form of a string, and you have to find the value of X in the string.<pre>Ex- String is 100000+200000=X\r\nX will be 300000\r\nString is 100000+X=500000\r\nX will be 400000</pre></li></li></ol><p>I Solved both the coding Questions.<p>Be prepared with all pointer concepts and how to return the char string, etc.<p><strong>Round 2 (Algorithm Round): </strong>I was told to introduce myself. Then he directly went on to the question. The question was :<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Given a square chessboard of N \xc3\x97 N size, the position of the Knight and the destination are given. You need to find out the minimum steps a Knight will take to reach the Destination and print the path for the same. (<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/steps-by-knight5927/1">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/steps-by-knight5927/1</a>)</li></ol><p>Initially, they give me a basic BFS solution that looks at all 8 K Knight modes that will take O (N \xc3\x97 N) Time.<p>I was told that I had done well in the code as a wise decision-maker. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the interviewer was expecting. I was thinking of the A * Search Algorithm that discarded a particular combination but lost the solution (meaning it comes close to the solution in a very short time, used by Google Maps).<p>I did not expect to qualify for this cycle. But luckily I was called to the next round.<p><strong>Round 3 (Algorithm Round): </strong>The interviewer was very chill. In the beginning, I introduced myself to her, and then she introduced herself. I was supposed to give a brief description of any one of my Project(10 min).<ol><li>Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k node.

The interviewer was very calm. He asked me about my Subjects. Then the fundamental knowledge was checked in depth. Ex-<ul><li>Paging / Virtual Memory<li>CPU Scheduling Algorithm<li>Deadlock / Semaphore / Critical Section<li>Working of OSI Layers(CN)<li>What happens if I type \xe2\x80\x98google.com\xe2\x80\x99 as URL. Explain the whole process.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 5 (Tech Round): </strong>The person you were interviewing was very knowledgeable. First I introduced myself. I was told to describe any of my projects, and he told me how he would improve the project now.<p>He then asked me one question of the tree \xe2\x80\x93 I was shaking my head, and I was just smiling, my interviewer thought I knew the question and asked me if I knew the question or not, and I said yes (even the question was unfamiliar but don\xe2\x80\x99t do this I was lucky at the time<p>Then he swapped the question. And asked this \xe2\x80\x93<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-the-two-binary-search-trees-are-identical-or-not/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-the-two-binary-search-trees-are-identical-or-not/</a></li></ol><p>I was supposed to just tell the Algorithm orally.
