Many approaches were discussed: Linear Search, Binary Search then TRIE.<p dir="ltr"><b>ROUND 3 F2F(60 mins):</b><p dir="ltr">This round was easy, i think just to check my coding skills.<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pythagorean-triplet/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array, find one pythagoras triplet.</a>.<p dir="ltr">2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mirror-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a binary tree convert it to its mirror tree</a>..<p dir="ltr">3.

Understand it.<p dir="ltr">2. If stuck, ask interviewer for hints, they are very co-operative.<p dir="ltr">3. Prepare Data Structures(especially Arrays, Trees, DP, Linked List, Stack, Queues, Strings, Heaps, Hashing for Amazon).<p dir="ltr">4. You should be flawless at explaining what you are currently doing and your past projects, future is a reflection of past.<p dir="ltr"><b></b>At last Thank you GeeksforGeeks\xc2\xa0for helping me through this.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
