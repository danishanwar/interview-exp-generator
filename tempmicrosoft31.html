It had two coding questions as follows:<ol><li>The first question was an easy problem based on dice rolling. You are given a total number of dice rolls <i>T</i> and a total sum <i>TotalSum</i> to achieve. <i>K</i> of those <i>T</i> rolls have been performed and the sum is <i>CurrentSum</i>. Your goal is to return the values of the remaining rolls such that your net sum is <i>TotalSum</i>.<li>The second question was similar to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-minimum-number-of-fountains-to-be-activated-to-cover-the-entire-garden/.</li></li></ol><p><i>About 40 students were shortlisted for the face-to-face interviews. All the rounds were mostly DSA based.</i><p><strong>Round \xc2\xa02(Coding Interview): </strong>Round 2 was a 45-minute coding interview with two coding questions. I had to first explain my approach before coding out my solution. The questions are as follows:<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diameter-of-a-binary-tree/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diameter-of-a-binary-tree/</a>. I was able to code out the optimal solution. We discussed the possible test cases and the interviewer was satisfied with my answer.<li>Given a string of alphabets, find the Kth smallest lexicographic character in it. I discussed the sorting approach and then explained my O(n) solution using Hashmaps. He asked me a follow-up question to find the Kth smallest character in between various L and R positions. The expected solution was preprocessing in O(n) and O(1) to fetch solutions for each L, R pair. (I was unable to code this solution due to insufficient time.)</li></li></ol><p><i>About 30 people were shortlisted for the next round.</i><p><strong>Round 3(Coding Interview): </strong>Round 3 was a coding interview similar to Round 2.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-element-sorted-matrix/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-element-sorted-matrix/</a>. I was able to implement and code out my binary search solution.<li>https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/. I discussed my DP solution and explained the approach for various test cases. (Did not code this solution due to time constraints.)</li></li></ol><p><i>About 20 people were shortlisted for the next round.</i><p><strong>Round 4(HR and Technical Interview): </strong>The interview began with a brief discussion on my projects and the challenges faced.<ul><li>I was asked a question on OS which I attempted but informed him that I have not learned it yet. He then asked me to design a phone log given phone numbers and their timestamps. The features were: Add a new call detail; Retrieve the top X most frequent calls in the past Y hours.<li>I did not have much idea and came up with a solution but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very optimal. This interview is just to judge how you think and your approach to complex problems.</li></li></ul><p><i>The results were announced after 4 hours and 16 people were selected for a summer internship at Microsoft.</i><p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Selected<p><strong>Some tips for preparation:</strong><ol><li>Be familiar with every concept and ensure you code the solution and not just read it.<li>Check out company-based questions on platforms like GeeksforGeeks and Interviewbit and try to solve them before looking at the solution.<li>Use a combination of sources like Leetcode, GeeksforGeeks, Hackerrank, etc, and set a 30-45 minute time limit to solve each question.<li>Have some good coding projects on your resume and ensure you can explain your contribution to it properly.<li>Try to keep talking to your interviewer and explain your thought process clearly.<li>Stay calm before and during the interview.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><i>All the best and happy coding!!</i><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
