Design a cache memory system for faster dns look ups.( i suggested a Trie and a min heap based solution).<br/>I was asked to make it space efficient. (I replaced trie with map)<p>3)There is a turn based 2 player game in which there are 9 pins and each player is allowed to pick either 1, 2 or 3 pins only. The last player to pick the pin is the loser.<br/>Design winning strategy for such a game.<p>4) Generalize the above solution for n pins.<p><strong>Round 2 (45 mins)</strong><br/>1)There is a large file with system memory limitations. How will you store it (i suggested Distributed system) and how will u work on it.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2)Suppose the large file contains name, address, Dob, pan no etc as attributes. Design class interface for such a system.The question was re framed again with more conditions which i am unable to recall now.<p>2)There was a detailed discussion over how the stl map data structure is implemented.<p>3) Discussion over hashing and collision resolution techniques.<p><strong>Round 3(40 mins)</strong><br/>Discussion over my project followed by these questions:<br/>1) Write the code to delete nodes in a binary tree which don\xe2\x80\x99t lie in any path from root to leaf with sum&gt;=k.<p>2)There is a rotated and pivoted array.
