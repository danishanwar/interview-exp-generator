Remove elements from the string such that no two adjacent characters are the same and find the min-cost for building that string.</li></li></ol><p>40 people were shortlisted after the coding round for interviews.<p>All the interview rounds were on Microsoft Teams<p><strong>Interview Round 1(Medium): </strong>The interviewer was helpful. First, he introduced himself and told me about his work at Microsoft, and then I was told to introduce myself.<p>Then he started with a simple ques:<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Given an array of n integers, all numbers are unique exception one of them.<ul><li>The repeating number repeats n/2 times if n is even<li>The repeating number repeats (n-1)/2 or (n+1)/2 times if n is odd<li>The repeating number is not adjacent to itself in the array</li></li></li></ul><p>Write a program to find the repeating number without using extra space<p>I solved the problem in O(n). Then he asked me to solve it in O(1) I did the same and he was happy with the solution.<li>Transport the materials<p>Some materials need to be transported from place A to place B. For transporting the materials, two trucks have been provided. Assume that each truck has enough capacity to carry all the materials in one go from place A to B. Unfortunately, some materials have restrictions on being stacked with the other materials in the same truck. The materials which cannot go together are provided as pairs.<p>Write a program to find out whether all materials can be sent using the two trucks in one go.<p>Also, if it is feasible to send in one go, list the materials that are being sent in each truck.<p>Please note that there are only 2 trucks.<p>Reading the ques, I just told him that I am feeling graph implementation with materials as nodes and restriction pairs as edges.<p>Then we just need to check if the graph is bipartite or not.<p>He asked me the complexity and I told since we will be using DFS time complexity will be O(n+m), n are nodes and m are edges</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></li></p></p></li></ol><p>The interviewer was happy because I gave the solution just after 1-2 mins of reading the question.<p><strong>Interview Round 2(Medium): </strong>After my introduction, he started with questions<ol><li>First, he asked me about virtual memory and its advantages.<p>I answered it correctly and then he further asked with an example of how we can run a 1.5GB game on a device with 1GB RAM.<p>The answer was \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d and the reason is virtual memory advantage but lagging might occur because of the page faults.<p>Then he asked me a coding ques.</p><li>Level order traversal of a binary tree but in inverse form i.e from the last level to first.<pre>Eg:\r\n     1\r\n   2    3\r\n 4  5 6   7\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n4 5 6 7\r\n2 3\r\n1</pre><p>He wanted me to use a data structure for the same. We can run BFS using Queue and for storing the nodes in the inverse form we can use stack<li>The last ques for this round was the string interleaving problem (standard DP ques). I was told to write the DP relation and the tabular approach.<p>I explained to him properly and he was happy with the final solution.</p></li></p></li></p></p></li></ol><p><strong>Interview Round 3(Medium): </strong>This round/final round was easy but the interviewer was strict. The interviewer was helpful but he wanted me to write the code efficiently without redundancies and in a proper format. First, he asked me about how was my day and how has the learning remotely going on.<p>Coding Ques:<ol><li>Find the least common ancestor of 2 nodes in a BST.<p>Simple question but there were many conditions we need to clarify with the interviewer.<p>Like what if both nodes are the same? in this case, return the parent of that node<p>what if both nodes are the same but the node is the root? return NULL for this case<p>what if one node is the parent of another? return parent of the node who was the parent of other<p>With proper discussion, I was able to code it properly.</p></p></p></p></p></li></ol><p><strong>Final Verdict: Selected</strong><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Be confident and ask questions to the interviewer when asked.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
