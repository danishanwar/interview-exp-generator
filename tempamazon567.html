The entire interview procedure was divided into a coding round and a set of 4 face to face interview.<p><strong>Online coding round:</strong><br/>It was a 90 minutes test with 22 questions(20 MCQs + 2 coding) set hosted on HackerRank.<p>Coding questions:<br/>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Reverse words in a string.</a><br/>Example: Let the input string be \xe2\x80\x9ci like this program very much\xe2\x80\x9d. The function should change the string to \xe2\x80\x9cmuch very program this like i\xe2\x80\x9d<p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subarray-with-given-sum/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Largest length of subarray with given sum.</a><p>MCQs consisted of OS, Geometry, Basic Maths, C ,Recursion and such topics.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Whoever solved atleast two questions were chosen for the interviews.<p><strong><br/>F2F 1(Technical):</strong><br/>He asked me about my Summer Internship Project at Microsoft India Development Centre, Hyderabad and asked me about several technologies involved in it and why I had used certain things.<br/>Then he moved on to two technical questions.<p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/finding-number/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a sorted and pivoted array, find an element given to you.</a><br/>I had given him a O(logn) solution with pivot finding and then doing binary search in either halves. But it was a O(logn) + O(logn), so he asked me to modify it to a one O(logn) question. After giving him the solution, he asked me to write production level code considering all corner test cases.<p>2. Given a BST which consists of marks of students in a class. It is found that all even ranked students have cheated,so we reduce k marks from their score. Modify the BST to make the change of marks without considering that after this operation, the BST might not remain a BST anymore.<p>I gave him a modified inorder traversal so that elements are sorted and solved it using a counter variable. He asked me to modify it to using neither a static counter variable nor a pointer passed to the recursive calls. For both questions, he also asked me the time and space complexity.<p><strong>F2F 2(Technical):</strong><br/>He asked a very brief idea about my Summer Internship again. Then he asked me 2 questions again.<p>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a k sized window in an array,find max element in each window.</a><br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/</a><p>I discussed a lot with him as to which data structure could be used and finally came up with a Queue solution. I was asked to code it again considering all the corner cases.<p>2.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/queue-using-two-stacks/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Implement a queue using stacks with the operations</a> (Enqueue,Dequeue,IsEmpty,Size).<br/>While I was telling him the solution,he even asked me whether I would prefer Arrays or Linked List implementation when i make a normal queue.<p>(Space and time complexity for both)<p><strong><br/>F2F 3(Technical):</strong><br/>He also asked me a brief introduction to my Summer Internship Project.<p>He began with the pros of cons or arrays and linked lists. Then a question on arrays:<p>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-odd-occurence/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given an array with all even elements present even number of times except one which is present odd number of times. Find that element</a>.<p>I started with XOR solution, but he told me the OS doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support XOR. So, I gave him a HashMap<int,int> solution. He went on asking me to optimize further. So at the end I had a space complexity of O(k) where k= number of unique elements.<br/>Asked me the Space and Time complexity of the most optimized solution.<p>2. Given four types of array<pre>\r\n a)Increasing(1,2,3,4)\r\n b)Decreasing(4,3,2,1)\r\n c)Increasing-decreasing(1,2,3,4,7,6,5)\r\n d)Decreasing-increasing(7,6,5,1,2,3,4) </pre><p>Find the type of array in O(1) and then find the maximum element in the array.<p>Except case c, max element is O(1). For c, I gave binary search solution. he asked me to write the code considering the corner cases.<p><strong>F2F 4(Bar raiser):</strong><br/>He asked me what my favorite subject was. I told DS,so he asked me from DS.<p>1. Write a class of circular queue using array implementation with Enqueue and Dequeue member functions.<p>2.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-whether-path-exist/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given a binary matrix( filled with 0 and 1 only) where 0 depicts water and 1 depicts land. We can traverse either up or down or left or right.Given a source and destination,find if we can reach the destination.</a><br/>He then modified it to finding the path followed and then the minimum path possible.<br/>(Code wasn\xe2\x80\x99t required)<p>3. Given a series of operations to build a project along with the time taken by each operation. Some operations are dependent on previous operations. Find the minimum number of days needed to finish the operation.<p>I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very sure of the solution I was thinking,so he said it was okay and concluded the interview.<p><strong>Tips:</strong><br/>1. Keep sharing your idea with the interviewer, he would help you a lot.<br/>2. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give up, you might come up with a brilliant idea with a little more thinking.<p>And do remember:<br/>\xe2\x80\x9cIf it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end well then it probably hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ended yet\xe2\x80\x9d<p>I would like to thank all my friends for all the support and a special thanks to GeeksForGeeks for their awesome website.
