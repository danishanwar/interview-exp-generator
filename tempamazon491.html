All these libraries must be linked appropriately to be included in Kindle. There will be dependencies between the libraries. Apply a suitable data structure such that a library cannot be added before its dependencies. I discussed a topological sort approach. Finally wrote code and tested the same.<li>Discussion about second coding question asked in the online test. I was asked to bring up a better solution, given, that I can use extra space. I proposed an approach based on hashing and counting sort.<li>Threads vs Process. They were impressed because I explained with a real-time example<li>How the Program is stored in memory?
