I took part in the internship drive and I am sharing my experience here.<h3>Round 1 (Online) :</h3><p>Everyone who satisfied the required cgpa (probably 7) criteria was allowed to sit for this round . It was mixture of aptitude and coding questions . The main parts were :<ol><li>Logical Reasoning \xe2\x80\x93 Questions based on basic mathematics , relations , paragraph based questions were asked .<li>Debugging \xe2\x80\x93 We were asked to correct the given code / write the output of the given code in preferred language (c++, java etc).<li>Coding \xe2\x80\x93<ol><li>Graph based question (BFS) :<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-distance-two-cells-matrix-grid/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-distance-two-cells-matrix-grid/</a><li>Matrix based question :\xc2\xa0<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/</a></li></li></ol></li></li></li></ol><p>I could solve both the coding questions in minimum time and space complexity .<h3>Round 2 (Pen and Paper Round) :</h3><p>We were given two DSA questions and we had to write production ready code from scratch in 30 mins. The questions were:<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/</a></li></li></ol><p>The code had to be syntactically correct and also all edge cases should have been covered . Additionally if you are confident enough do mention the time and space complexities. Small things like <strong>proper variable names , edge cases consideration , neat code</strong> makes a huge difference .<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><h3>Round 3 (PI) :</h3><p>This was the first face to face interview round . The interviewer was friendly and made me feel at ease before starting the interview . First he had a quick look at my cv . I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any personal project / previous internships / extra technical skills .So I was asked mostly conceptual questions . \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<p>He asked me my preferred programming language . (I said C++). He asked me some questions on object oriented programming aspect like what are the main features of object oriented programming , difference between the access specifiers , where to use what , what are the benefits of oop , inheritance &amp; polymorphism in depth etc .\xc2\xa0<p>He asked me some dbms questions . I was asked to write one or two sql queries mainly based on joins.<p>Then he shifted to DSA . I was asked about hashing \xe2\x80\x93 how it is implemented , types etc . I was also asked to design a hash function of my own . I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer this question perfectly . Then I was asked two DSA questions \xe2\x80\x93<ol><li>LCA : <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/\xc2\xa0</a><p>At first I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give the space optimized solution . He gave me some hints and ultimately I could give the space optimized solution .<br/>\xc2\xa0<li>https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/<p>I could give the recursive solution for this but it was not space optimized , so he gave me several hints . I followed them ,even went in the right direction but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with the correct solution . However I shared my thought process throughout the discussion .</p></li></p></li></ol><p>This round took about 1 hour . Some of my friends were called for a second PI round .<p><strong>NOTE \xc2\xa0: \xc2\xa0</strong>It\xe2\x80\x99s better to be fluent in java as most interviewers prefer that . Also it\xe2\x80\x99s not always important to give the correct code. The way we are approaching the question , our thought process matters as well . Therefore <strong>think loud</strong>.<p><strong>Verdict : Selected\xc2\xa0</strong>\xc2\xa0<p>I practiced from geeksforgeeks for about 5-6 months . Initially I practiced topic wise , later when I was confident enough I started practicing company wise ( mainly for those companies which visited our campus). Also I made it a habit to read atleast one interview experience from gfg daily .<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
