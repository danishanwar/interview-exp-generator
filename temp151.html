Amazon visited our university for the role of SDE Intern (6 months).<p><strong>ROUND 1 (Online </strong>Assessment<strong> Test): </strong>Initially, an online assessment test was conducted to shortlist candidates for the interview process.<p>Online test consists of four sections:<p><strong>Debugging: </strong>This section had 7 debugging problems, which consist of code snippets that have some logical error that needs to be rectified. I solved all 7 problems. They were very easy.<p><strong>Reasoning Ability:</strong> This section consists of some verbal reasoning questions and some aptitude questions. The question level was easy.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Coding: </strong>This section consists of 2 coding problems.<ul><li>My first question was a simple matrix problem which I solved within 3\xe2\x80\x935 minutes.<li>The second question was to determine if a given tree S is a valid subtree of a tree T. I solved this problem as well.</li></li></ul><p>The final section was a kind of survey or behavioural analysis. It consists of various work or behaviour related questions.<p>Around 30 candidates were shortlisted from my campus and over 150+ candidates were shortlisted from the university, and I was one of them. Then my first round of interviews was scheduled. I was pretty nervous before the interview.<p><strong>Round 2 (Technical Interview): </strong>My interviewer introduced himself in the beginning and asked for my introduction.<ol><li>The first question he asked was Product Array Puzzle. It was a simple problem that I was able to solve after a little thinking. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-product-array-puzzle/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-product-array-puzzle/</a><li>The second problem he asked about was an Asteroid collision problem. I tried to solve this problem. Thought of various approaches but was not able to solve this problem. I told one of my approaches to the interviewer, after discussing my approach, finally, he asked me to code the solution. My approach was not that straight forward as a result I was not able to code it properly, and he was not satisfied with the solution. https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/</li></li></ol><p>The interview was time-bound and I took most of my time solving the second problem leaving me no time to move forward.<p>Finally, the interview was over and as I knew already, I was not selected for the second round.<p><strong>PS:</strong> I solved my second problem within 5 minutes after the interview was over. Maybe I just got nervous and thought too much. It was a simple problem with a straight forward and easy approach (using stack)<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
