Both coding questions were medium level and I was able to solve almost both of them. After one week of this round, I got a selection mail from their recruitment team for the next rounds. All the interviews were conducted on the Amazon Chime platform.<p><strong>Interview Round 1(Feb 2022):</strong> The interviewer(SDE-2) started with a quick introduction about myself and then asked me to explain one of my projects, followed by some questions on that project. After the project discussion, we moved to the coding questions. I was asked to explain the best approach, write code for it and tell about space and time complexity.<ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-array-converting-elements-squares/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-array-converting-elements-squares/</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-leaf-nodes-value-x/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delete-leaf-nodes-value-x/</a></li></li></ul><p>I was able to solve both questions in the given time and got good feedback from the interviewer.
