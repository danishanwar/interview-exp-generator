Three coding questions were asked.<ol><li>Find the number of page faults given cache size \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99 and the page replacement algorithm is LRU.</li></ol><p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I solved this using a doubly ended queue in python. The interviewer was convinced by this approach.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 2. Given a very large number \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99. Find the number of k digits with the second-highest frequency.\xc2\xa0<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<strong> \xc2\xa0Ex:\xc2\xa0</strong><pre>n=12341234567856785678 k=4     \r\nOutput:1234</pre><p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 3.

The interviewer asked me to do it in O(n) time.<p><strong>Second Round: </strong>This was also a coding round. Two coding questions were asked.<ol><li>Given a dictionary where the values are the connections of the key. Find if a person A can send a connection request to person B. A person can only send a connection request if the number of connections between the two people is at most \xe2\x80\x98k\xe2\x80\x99.</li></ol><pre>Input: {1:[2,3,4], 4:[5,6],6:[7,8]} k=1 A=1 B=8\r\nOutput: NO</pre><p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I initially decided to use the DFS approach but the interviewer pointed out that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to calculate the path, only the number of nodes. So I applied BFS and kept track of the level. If the level exceeded k before i found the node, I printed No else Yes.<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 2. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-ways-reach-nth-stair/" target="_blank">Find the number of ways to climb \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99 stairs.\xc2\xa0</a><p><strong>Third Round: </strong>This round was a technical round as well. One coding question and multiple concept based questions were asked.<ol><li>Given a number \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99, construct all the possible structurally different binary trees(not BST)</li></ol><p><strong>Other questions that were asked were:</strong><ol><li>Difference between semaphore and mutex<li>Discussion of deadlock conditions, deadlock prevention, and recovery<li>Normalisation<li>Converting a given table to 2NF then 3NF and BCNF.</li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Fourth Round (Bar Raiser): </strong>This round was a mix of behavioral + technical questions.<p>It started with a discussion of my internship project. Then the following questions were asked.<ol><li>Tell me about a time when you learned something on your own. Why did you learn it?<li>Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with your teammates and how did you handle it.<li>Tell me about a time when you were stuck at something. How did you handle it?</li></li></li></ol><p>A few other questions regarding teamwork were asked<p>One coding question:<ol><li>Given a list of dependencies of a module, print the build order of that module.</li></ol><pre>Input: A-&gt; B,C,D  | B-&gt; C,F   |  C-&gt;E  Print build order of A\r\nOutput: E C F D B A  (Multiple correct answers were possible)</pre><p>I discussed the DFS approach and was asked to code it. The interviewer was satisfied with my approach.<p>After waiting for two weeks, I got my results. I was offered an FTE + 6 months internship.<p><strong>Note: </strong>When approaching the coding questions, think loudly. Discuss your approach with the interviewer first and take into account the suggestions provided. Think about the time and space complexity of your code and discuss that with your interviewer. Most importantly, be calm and composed throughout your interview as it would help you a lot. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
