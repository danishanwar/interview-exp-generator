It was a F2F round and the interviewer was nice. He asked me two problems.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>there are n staircases and a person has to go to nth stair he can take any number of steps based on his age, for eg. if his age is 5 then he can take 1 step, or 2 steps or 3 steps or 4 steps or 5 steps. I gave the solution and then he asked for complexity and then asked me to optimize it.<li>There is a graph, we can go from one node to other node either for free or for a cost(that cost is the same for each path). Find the path which connects the source to destination with min cost. I answered it but my approach was not good enough so he helped me out for the same.</li></li></ol><p>At last, he asked me to code the solution for both the question.<p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>This round was again F2F and lasted for 75 min.<p>The interviewer asked me a few ques about OS. and then two coding questions.<ol><li>print the path between two nodes of the Binary Tree. I gave the approach but was unable to code.<li>how will you find a k largest elements in a file(containing integers) of the size of 1 GB.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4:</strong><p>This round was F2F and lasted for 60 min.<p>The interviewer asked me 1 ques.\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/</a><p>I gave him approach and then he asked me to code it. I was unable to it.<p>Then he asked me that I have any question for him so I asked a few ques.<p>\xc2\xa0<p>After this HR round was there but I was not selected for it.<p>It was a nice experience.<p>PS:- This year the amazon interview process is strict they are asking a new type of questions, not from the predefined set so its better have a new approach to solve a question.<p>I was selected in Round 2 only because my approach to the question was out of the league, I was unable to fully code it but the interviewer was highly impressed.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
