Basic criteria to apply for Microsoft internship program was to have CGPA greater than 7.0, no pending backlogs and candidates should not have participated in Microsoft internship hiring process within the last one year.<p><strong>Round 1(Online Round):</strong><p>It was Online coding Round conducted in mettl.com on January 6th, 2019.\xc2\xa0 Everyone got 3 different question which needs to be solved in 90 minutes. Level\xc2\xa0of questions was easy-easy-medium. Each question contains corner test cases and also test cases with small and large inputs.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Those who solved all three questions completely (passing all test cases)were called for Onsite Interview at VIT-Chennai.<p><strong>Round 2(Group Fly):</strong><p>It was a pen-paper Round and from here each round is an elimination\xc2\xa0round. Do write clean and correct codes, with appropriate names for variables and proper indentation. The paper contains two sections 2 subjective questions and 2 objective questions. For\xc2\xa0subjective questions, we were asked to write test cases also.<p><strong>subjective questions:</strong><p>1.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists-such-that-merged-list-is-in-reverse-order/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists-such-that-merged-list-is-in-reverse-order/</a><p>2.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/run-length-encoding/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/run-length-encoding/</a>(without any extra memory)<p><strong>\xc2\xa0Objective\xc2\xa0 questions:\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</strong><p>1. Given a code we have to identify the output of the given code. The\xc2\xa0question I got was Minimum-edit-distance.<p>2. Find\xc2\xa0the error in the code. The code was adding two LinkedList.<p>Around 20 were shortlisted to next round out of 120 students.<p><strong>Round 3(1 hr 15 min):</strong><p>From now it is a technical round where each person is assigned, one mentor. After\xc2\xa0Introduction, I was asked to write code in a paper for a given question. The way we approach a problem and communication of our thought process makes a difference. Finally, they need is a proper algorithm for a given problem. I was given two questions,<p>1.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/</a><p>2. Nested conditional statement and I wrote a recursive solution and interviewer traced my\xc2\xa0code.<p><strong>Round 4(1 hr):</strong><p>The first interviewer asked me to find a cycle in a graph and I\xc2\xa0gave dfs approach for the problem and he\xc2\xa0told to solve a problem without using extra space(visited array) and after seeing my resume he asked gave me\xc2\xa0problem\xc2\xa0based\xc2\xa0on my project (i.e) to find the word from a paragraph. I\xc2\xa0gave a trie-based approach and he\xc2\xa0told to write a function for insertion of a word and searching a word on paper. Both\xc2\xa0logical and syntactical errors were identified and he told to correct it.<p><strong>Round 5 (30 min):</strong><p>This was very easy round for me and solved the problem very quickly. The problem was given a wall which contains two kinds of bricks porous (water passes through given brick) and opaque( water passes doesnot passes through given brick). Given a matrix filled with p and o, find water passes to the ground if poured from the top. I\xc2\xa0discussed a dfs approach and he told to write code on paper. After that he told my Interview is over and the result will be announced through mail after a week.<p>Finally the way we approach and solve a problem is important. GeeksforGeeks is the best place to practice for interviews.<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
