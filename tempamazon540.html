Here I am sharing my interview experience. There was 1 online round and 3 F2F interviews and 1 Bar Raiser round.<p>Online round had 2 coding questions and 20 (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/">MCQs</a> based on sorting complexity, Recursion, quantitative aptitude , geometry etc).<p><strong>F2F 1</strong><p>He introduced himself and asked me about my project.<br/>Then He asked me these questions<br/>1. <a href="http://Maximum of all subarrays of size k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find the maximum of all subarrays of size k</a>.<p>I gave him a o(n*n) approach, then o(n*log(n)) approach using segment tree, then o(n*log(k)) using max heap and then o(n) approach using deque. He asked me to write the full production level code.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/right-most-non-zero-digit/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find the first non-zero digit starting from right in n!\xc2\xa0Simply keep the last digit of every multiplication, gave an o(n) approach.</a> He seemed to be satisfied.<p><strong>F2F 2</strong><p>He asked the following questions<p>1. He asked me to make a dictionary in which i had to search a string and if it is not present , i had to insert in dictionary.\xc2\xa0Gave a o(n*log(n)) approach using map. He asked to optimize it , then gave a trie approach. He asked me to write full code for it.<p>2. He asked me, <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what is LRU cache and how it is implemented.</a> Then he asked me to write the full production level code for it.<p><strong>F2F 3</strong><p>This interview was a design round as well as theoretical round.<p>1. Firstly, he asked me about my favorite subjects. I told him operating system. Then he asked me about process scheduling algorithms and then he asked me how will you allocate memory to a newly formed file. I told him about first fit, best fit and worst fit. He asked me what are the advantages and disadvantages of these.<p>2. Then he asked me a design question. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you have a 13 floor building and it has 6 lifts in it, you have to design an algorithm such that if a user click the lift button, any of the available lift should reach to him in minimal time.<p>3. Then he asked to give the design for top k trends of twitter of facebook. I told him that i\xe2\x80\x99ll keep a trie for storing the count of the number of users associated with a particular trend and will keep this count in max heap and will extract top k trends.<p>Solution for design varies from candidate to candidate. so you should design your own solution rather than searching solution on google.<p><strong>F2F 4</strong><p>This was a Bar raiser round and it was telephonic. He asked about my project and we had discussion on it in detail . After 40 minutes he asked me to write the full production level code on implementing LRU using circular linked list. It was easy and i had done that in second round also, so i wrote the whole code and he was satisfied.<p>verdict: selected \xf0\x9f\x98\x9b<p><strong>Thanks GeeksforGeeks !!</strong><br/>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
