Then he asked me a puzzle and ended the interview. The interview lasted for around 45 mins.<p><strong>Round 4</strong>\xe2\x80\x93 It was the HR round.<br/>HR was a very cool guy. He asked me questions regarding my project. Then a few puzzles. He then asked some theory questions from around everywhere such as DBMS, OS, networking. Surprisingly he did not ask any coding question. He then asked me about my future plans and why I had such a low cgpa(8.31). He then asked me if I had any questions for him, then we had a 10 mins discussion on my question. The interview lasted for around 80 mins.<p>Finally, 3 people were given an internship at our college. My suggestion is to keep your calm in the whole interview process, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t answer any one of the questions just don\xe2\x80\x99t panic and try to give your best in the next question.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
