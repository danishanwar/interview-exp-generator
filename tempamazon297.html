Last week Amazon came to select for the 2-month summer Internship program. At first, there was an online test to shortlist candidates for interviews. The test contained 5-7 debugging questions, 30 aptitude questions, and 2 coding questions.<br/>Two coding questions:<ol><li>Given an array and a number. We have to find the maximum sum of two numbers from an array which is less than the given number.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-round-robin-scheduling-set-1/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-round-robin-scheduling-set-1/</a></li></li></ol><p>They selected 120 students for interviews.<p>In my interview 2 questions were asked to code with pen paper:<ol><li>Given 2 N-ary trees, check if they are mirror of each other or not.<li>Given 2-D array of characters, check the given words are there in the array or not. (crossword type.)</li></li></ol><p>I did 1st one correct and for the second one I could not complete it but the interviewer was convinced with the approach. I got selected for the summer internship at Amazon.<br/>I would like to thank Geeksforgeeks. As during my preparation, I always found it easy to surf it. The collection of must-do coding questions is very good and helps you build confidence.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
