B.Tech. (Sem 5), when Microsoft visited our campus for offering 2 months summer internship.<p>First Round was online coding test on CoCubes Platform. Difficulty level of questions were easy to medium. 3 Coding questions were to be solved. Questions Were<ol><li>A Number plate problem where only odd and even number plate vehicles can go out on a weekday. Given numbers of vehicle and schedule of odd/even on weekday, find maximum number of vehicles that can go out on a day.<li>A problem based on BFS of Graph. Similar to Rotten Oranges Problem.<li>Given a Singly Linked List, Reverse the linked list in place using O(1) space.</li></li></li></ol><p>Some Other Questions were<ol><li>Reverse a Linked List in groups of size K<li>Some traversal problem based on BST and graph.</li></li></ol><p>Nearly 25 students passed this round.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 2: On Paper Coding Round</strong><p>Groups were formed and each group was assigned a mentor. We were supposed to explain the approach of problems given to our mentor and code on paper. Questions Were :<ol><li>Check if a given Binary tree is a BST without using extra space.<li>Finding second maximum element of the array.<li>Find Depth of BST.</li></li></li></ol><p>I found inorder traversal of the tree for first problem but no extra space was to be used. I reduced the space complexity to O(1) but time complexity was O(n). I found depth of BST using Recursion.<p>Nearly 15 students were selected for Face to Face interviews. I was one of them.<p><strong>Round 3: Face to Face Interview \xe2\x80\x93 1</strong><p>Questions asked during my interview were :<ol><li>Write on paper code for Binary Search<li>Implement a Queue data structure using Stack data structure.<li>Write a code to heapify a array. It was basically a Heap Data Structure problem but I messed up here.<li>Asked about Dynamic Programming and a question to find longest palindromic subsequence.<li>ACID property of DBMS.</li></li></li></li></li></ol><p>Only 5 people cleared this round and I was rejected after this.<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
