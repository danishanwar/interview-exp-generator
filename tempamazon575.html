The process was :<p><strong>ONLINE ROUND</strong><br/>2 Coding questions and 20 MCQs . The coding questions were:<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lexicographically-minimum-string-rotation/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lexicographically-minimum-string-rotation/</a><li>It was an easy string question similar to <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/parenthesis-checker/0">finding that the parenthesis are balanced or not</a> . Instead of the parenthesis , a and b were to be checked for , For eg )<br/>ababab is balanced ;Its a good string<br/>abbbaa is a bad string .</li></li></ol><p>I had practised MCQS from\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/quiz-corner/</a> \xc2\xa0and many of the MCQs I had seen here before that were asked in the test. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/algorithms-gq/searching-and-sorting-gq/">Sorting</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structure-gq/hash-gq/">hashing</a>,<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/algorithms-gq/analysis-of-algorithms-gq/"> complexity</a>,\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/algorithms-gq/recursion-gq/">recursion</a> based MCQs were asked.<p>Also, 2 questions on <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/">OS</a> , 1 on <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/">Networking</a> and 1 on <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner-gq/">DBMS</a> was present. I did not attempt these since there was negative marking .\xc2\xa0I solved around 14-15 MCQs and both the coding questions . (However, some students completing 1 were also selected .)<div><strong>ROUND 1</strong></div><p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-a-binary-tree/1" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialize-deserialize-binary-tree/</a><br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/level-order-traversal-in-spiral-form/1">Spiral level order traversal </a>of a binary tree from bottom level to top level.( I was allowed to use extra space(O(n)) .)<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>ROUND 2</strong><br/>This round was easier than the previous one for me and went smooth .<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/boolean-matrix-problem/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Set the rows and columns of a matrix equal to zero if an element in that row or column is zero</a> (The elements could be positive or negative too ). I told him the solution using O(n) space . He then asked me to do it without the auxiliary space and I told him that it was not possible . (A solution without space could be given if all the elements were either non-negative or non-positive )<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-k-sorted-linked-lists/1">Merge k sorted linked lists </a>. I discussed the approach using priority queue . Then he proposed another method of merging two lists into one and then merging it with the next . I explained him the complexities of both the approaches and then wrote the code for priority queue approach . He was impressed.</li></li></ol><p>I would like to thank <strong>GeeksforGeeks</strong> for providing a huge set of problems for practicing for interviews. The internship archives were extremely helpful . Also I practiced on\xc2\xa0<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/">https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/ </a>and interviewbit regularly in the summer break.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to review-team@geeksforgeeks.org.
