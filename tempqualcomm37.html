The process had\xc2\xa0three rounds.<p><strong>Round 1: Logical\xc2\xa0reasoning and Technical test</strong><p>In this round, there were 60 questions that had to be completed in 60 minutes. Out of the 30 questions, 20 were logical reasoning aptitude questions and 10 were technical questions(code output, debugging, DBMS, OS, networking etc.). Around 40 students were shortlisted for the next round.<p><strong>Round 2: Coding test</strong><p>This round had 2 coding questions which had to be done in 3 hours. Again, this test was on their\xc2\xa0own platform. Also, the interesting part of this test was, browsing the internet to solve questions was allowed. The questions were practical problems rather than standard\xc2\xa0coding questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>The first question was based on string formatting. It was for 50 points.<p>The second question was to parse given lines of code\xc2\xa0that are written in a\xc2\xa0new language whose syntax and rules were given in the question and processing\xc2\xa0the code to generate the corresponding output. It was for 150 points.<p>They shortlisted 6 students for the next round.<p><strong>Round 3: F2F Interview\xc2\xa0</strong><p>This round took place in their Noida office.<ol><li>They asked questions from\xc2\xa0my resume and on previous projects and technologies that\xc2\xa0I had used.<li>They analyzed the results of the coding round and told\xc2\xa0me all the test cases and asked me to make corrections in\xc2\xa0my code for incorrect test cases.<li>They asked to\xc2\xa0write a simple C++ program to evaluate infix arithmetic\xc2\xa0expressions. (Hint: Ask for different test cases, convert expression to postfix and then evaluate)<li>Lastly, they asked to\xc2\xa0<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write a program to add two numbers that are represented as a linked list.</a></li></li></li></li></ol><p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
