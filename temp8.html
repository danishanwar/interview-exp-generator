In code explanation, you need to explain your approach and the time and space complexity. I do not exactly remember the coding questions asked, but one was leetcode easy, and the other was leetcode medium.<p><strong>Round 2(Technical round 1): </strong>The interviewer asked me to introduce myself. Then gave the following coding questions.<ul><li>Variation of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-whether-it-is-possible-to-finish-all-tasks-or-not-from-given-dependencies/">prerequisite tasks.</a><li>A simple array-based question that used 2 pointer approach.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3(Technical Round 2): </strong>The interviewer asked me to introduce myself. Then gave the following coding questions.<ul><li>Variation of this question: \xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-a-set-into-two-subsets-such-that-the-difference-of-subset-sums-is-minimum/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-a-set-into-two-subsets-such-that-the-difference-of-subset-sums-is-minimum/</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/">Rotten oranges.</a></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 4(Bar raiser): The interviewer</strong> asked me to introduce myself. Then he asked some questions from my resume.<ul><li>\xc2\xa0Tell me about the project mentioned in your resume.<li>\xc2\xa0Variation of stock buy and sell. Took more than 30 mins to understand and do this. The interviewer was not clear with his requirements. \xc2\xa0Finally did this with recursion.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 5(Managerial round): </strong>The interviewer was very nice. He interacted with me very well. Asked several behavioral questions. Some were,<ul><li>Tell about a time when you did something challenging.<li>Tell about a time when you did something innovative.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Tips</strong>: Keep practicing daily Practice from GFG and leetcode, that should be enough. Do not take behavioral questions lightly and practice them during the end days before your interview. Make 5-6 stories at least.<p>Verdict:<strong> Selected</strong><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
