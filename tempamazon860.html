Find the row which contains maximum number of 1s.</a><br/>I was asked to code. Algo which I told was I will search position of first 1 in 1st row using binary search. And mark it. Now note that position check in 2nd row. If there is 1 for that position already found in 1st row, then binary search from 0 to that position else move to row number 3.
