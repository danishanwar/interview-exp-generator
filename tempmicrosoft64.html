The level of paper was tough. Only 7 were shortlisted. The questions was based on Machine learning Algorithms, probability and counting, statistics. It was conducted on Mettl. If you are able to solve 50% part, then you can expect a call.<p><strong>Round 2 (Technical Interview) :\xc2\xa0</strong><p>Focus : Problem solving skills<p>1st question was based on the trees. I was given an input and a binary tree. My task is to delete all leave nodes whose data is equal to the given input (wait it\xe2\x80\x99s not that simple, you to need to implement cascade delete in this question). I tell him the approach and it was correct. Then he told me to write the code for it. I tried and reached very close to the result but missed one condition. Then he asked few questions on neural networks, sentimental analysis. He gave me a problem that how to classify flight booking emails from other mails. I gave several ideas and approach. It was an open ended question so totally depends on the interviewer whether he likes ur idea or not. After this round 1 was over. It lasts for 50 minutes.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Tip : Practice some questions on Trees and Graphs from gfg. Also read puzzle section.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round 3 (Face to face interview) :</strong><p>Focus : Projects and Domain knowledge\xc2\xa0<p>he told me to introduce myself. Then he quickly jumped to my projects section and ask every project one by one in depth. He asked several thing on Neural Network, CNN, Bagging Boosting, decision trees, activation layers. How to prevent overfitting, Regularization etc. How to mix more then one ML Algorithms. How to think, which algo should we apply in any particular scenario. That\xe2\x80\x99s all about second round. It lasts for 45 min.<p>Verdict : None of us got selected for this profile.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
