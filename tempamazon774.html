He modified problem many times don\xe2\x80\x99t use extra space do it in space etc. discussion went on for almost 1 hour but at the end he was happy with the solutions(I suggested 2 method and further optimization in them.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximize-number-of-1s/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">U have given an binary matrix which is sorted row wise and column wise write a program to search a row in the matrix having maximum number of zeroes.</a></li></li></ol><p>Finally this interview also went well he was happy with my performance<p>After 2-3 days I got mail from the HR that I m rejected LL reason was bar raiser \xe2\x80\xa6 1 advise to all don\xe2\x80\x99t take BR round lightly it does not matter how well u performed in other round if u didn\xe2\x80\x99t do well in BR round then there is no way u can make it. An average round tech interview is fine but average BR round means rejected.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
