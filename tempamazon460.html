There were <strong>2 coding questions</strong> (no penalty for wrong submission) and <strong>20 Multiple Choice Questions</strong>(with negative marking). We were given 90 minutes to solve them.<br/>MCQs were based on Data Structures, OS, CN, C outputs, OOP, etc.<br/>The two coding questions were:<ol><li>Given a string you have to partition it in such a way that each part of the partitioned string is a palindrome in itself and you have to count the number of such partitions.<pre>\r\nInput: NITIN\r\nOutput: 3\r\nExplanation: The 3 possible partitions are N | ITI | N, N | I | T | I | N, NITIN\r\n</pre><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/palindromic-patitioning/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>You are given a large paragraph and N words. You have to find a minimum length subparagraph of the paragraph which contains all those N words in any order. Here, the length of a paragraph is the count of words in the paragraph.<p><strong><br/>Round 1 (Face to Face):</strong><br/>The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and a brief introduction of the projects that I have done. She first asked me questions related to my project. After that she moved on to the data structures part. The questions were:<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-sort/1">Merge Sort.</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-a-pair-with-given-target-in-bst/1">Given a BST containing distinct integers, and a number \xe2\x80\x98X\xe2\x80\x99, find all pairs of integers in the BST whose sum is equal to \xe2\x80\x98X\xe2\x80\x99.</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-intervals/0">Merge overlapping Intervals.</a></li></li></li></ol><p>The interviewer asked me to code all the problems on paper and dry run each of them for some test cases.<p>Some questions asked to other candidates in this round were:<ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-permutation/0">Find next greater number with same set of digits</a><li>Given a binary tree, if parent is 0, then left child is 0 and right child is 1. if parent is 1, then left child is 1 and right child is 0. Root of the tree is 0. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13938830/find-the-kth-node-in-nth-level-of-binary-tree">Find the kth node value which is present at Nth level.</a></li></li></ol><p><strong><br/>Round 2 (Face to Face):</strong><br/>The interviewer asked me about how my previous round went. After that, he asked me to introduce myself and a brief introduction of the projects that I have done. He first asked me a few questions related to my project. Then he moved on to the data structures part.<br/>The questions were:<ol><li>He asked me about different types of hashing. He then asked me an <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-set-1-introduction/">alternative</a> and a better way for Linear Chaining.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/avl-tree-deletion/1">Implement AVL Tree.</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/get-minimum-squares/0">Minimum number of squares whose sum equals to given number n.</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort-for-singly-linked-list/">Insertion sort for a singly linked list.</a></li></li></li></li></ol><p>For the second question, I told him that I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember rotations in an AVL Tree so I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to code it. Also, in this round the interviewer gave me strict time limit for coding the solution on paper for each problem and as soon as I was done coding he gave me 2-3 minutes every time to find errors and debug my code.<p>This article is contributed by Samkit Jain.
