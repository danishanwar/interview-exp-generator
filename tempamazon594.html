Then he asked me a coding question<p>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reorder-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a linked list eg : 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6, make the following changes 1-&gt;6-&gt;2-&gt;5-&gt;3-&gt;4</a><br/>Easy but it was lengthy. Had to write production level code.<p>After 2-3 hours, I got an invitation for in house interview at Amazon campus:<p><strong>Round 1 : Face 2 Face</strong><br/>It started with a discussion about my previous work and projects. After the discussion he asked the following technical questions:<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/construct-tree-from-preorder-traversal/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a pre-order traversal, construct a binary search tree</a>.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Simple solution. Asked me to code it.<p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/alien-dictionary/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an alien dictionary, find the order of the alphabets in the dictionary.</a><br/>Only the approach was required. I explained him the approach and he was satisfied. Here is the link to the code anyway:<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-dictionary-find-precedence-characters/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-dictionary-find-precedence-characters/</a><p>3) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-cost-of-ropes/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Connect n ropes with minimum cost</a><p>I was asked to write production level code for the above problem.<p><strong>Round 2 : Face to Face</strong><br/>Again the interview started with a discussion about my projects and then he asked a technical question.<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-k-sorted-arrays/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given m sorted arrays with n elements, merge these arrays into one sorted array of size m*n</a><br/>I did hear about this question before but never really saw the optimized solution so I gave a O(m*m*n) solution. He asked me to optimize it, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to do so, hence he asked me to code the O(m*m*n) solution. I took a lot of time to code it as I wanted to handle all the edge cases. Finally I coded it. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t find any issues but he asked me to make it better. And then I suggested using heaps to get the minimum of all the m arrays.<p>Lot of questions on why heap and why not BST. Asked me to prove it mathematically.<br/>But he was satisfied once I gave the solution using heaps.<p><strong>Round 3 Bar Raiser : Telephonic</strong><br/>Discussion on my previous projects and asked some behavioral questions like why are you leaving your current company, conflicts with your manager etc<p>Technical questions:<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/finding-number/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing</a><p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pythagorean-triplet/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find the Pythagoras triplet in an array</a><br/>Gave an O(n3) solution then made it O(n2logn). He asked me to optimize it even further.<br/>Finally came up with O(n2) solution.<p>3) Given a very large binary number which cannot be stored in a variable, determine the remainder of the decimal equivalent of the binary number when divided by 3<br/>I had no clue about this question. He gave me a hint, with which I was able to solve it. But later, he asked me to find the remainder for any number k. Again he gave a hint and I was able to solve it.<p>Basically when we append a digit to a binary number, the previous binary number gets doubled, hence the remainder also gets doubled.<pre>\r\nFor example :     101  -&gt; 5\r\n          1010 -&gt; 2*5 + 0 = 10\r\n              1011 -&gt; 2*5 + 1 = 11\r\n        \r\nIf k = 3 then  \r\n    5 = 1*3 + 2\r\n    2*5 = 2*3 + 2*2 \r\nHence the remainder will be\r\n(2*2 + 0)%3 = 1 for 1010\r\n\r\nSimilarly for 1011 the remainder\r\nwill be (2*2 + 1)%3 = 2 </pre><p>By keeping track of the remainder of the previous binary number, the current remainder can be determined.<p><strong>Round 4 Hiring Manager: Face to Face</strong><br/>Behavioral questions along with some questions about my previous projects.<br/>Then he gave me a technical question:<br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-to-words/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a number say \xe2\x80\x981234\xe2\x80\x99, return the number in words i.e One thousand two hundred and thirty four</a><p>Was able to cover all the scenarios. He was satisfied with my approach<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong><br/>Think loud and be confident. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer at first. They mostly see how you solve questions for which you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the solution.<p>Thanks geeksforgeeks.
