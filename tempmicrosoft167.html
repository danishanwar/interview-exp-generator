The <strong>first round</strong> was on cocubes. There were different sets and the questions that I had in my set were:-<ol><li>Given two numbers, \xe2\x80\x98m\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99, after adding m+n if the no of digits in m + n and n are same return n, otherwise, return m + n. (2 marks)<li><a href="https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALIN/">Given a number in the form of a string, return the next smallest palindrome bigger than the given number</a>. (3 marks)<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/build-lowest-number-by-removing-n-digits-from-a-given-number/">Given a number in the form of a string, remove k elements from it so that it forms the smallest number possible.</a>\xc2\xa0 (5 marks)</li></li></li></ol><p>Questions from other sets: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-bst-keys-outside-the-given-range/">Trim BST</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expression-evaluation/">Evaluate Infix Expression</a>, average of Ascii characters, some question related to date (sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember), and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-a-given-linked-list-in-place/">reordering the linked list nodes</a>.<p>I did the first two efficiently and did the last question with brute force (checking all combinations and selecting the smallest one) as I was not able to come up with the efficient approach.<p>From about 200 students, 68 students were selected for group fly round.<p><strong>Group Fly Round</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2 questions were given to be solved in 2 hours. Both were pretty standard dynamic programming questions.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-strictly-increasing-array-minimum-changes/">Remove min no of elements such that the resulting sequence is in strictly increasing order</a>.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/word-break-problem-dp-32/">Word Break problem</a>. Our problem was a slight variation of the problem in the link. We had to find if the string forms a meaningful sentence with <strong>fewest</strong> words possible.</li></li></ol><p>28 students were selected for next round.<p><strong>F2F Interview Round 1</strong><p>I was interviewed by the senior most engineer from Microsoft. He greeted me and then became serious afterwards. He gave me the problem <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-tour-that-visits-all-stations/">gas stations</a>. First he asked whether I had solved it before, to which I said no, as I had not solved it before.<p>I gave him two approaches, the O(n^2) one where I would check every pump for a circular tour. Then he asked me to improve the solution to linear time, and I did it.<p>Then he gave me another problem, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-dictionary-find-precedence-characters/">Alien Dictionary</a>. I was discussing my approach but said me to move on as I was taking too much time. He then asked me if I had any questions for him. I asked him what he does on daily basis at Microsoft. He replied to my question happily. And asked me to wait.<p>I thought I will be rejected as I did not solve the second question completely, but by the grace of God, I was allowed to sit for further rounds.<p><strong>F2F Interview Round 2</strong><p>This round was good. The interviewer was very friendly and calm. He first introduced himself and asked my to give a quick introduction. Then he also asked me about my interests. Then he asked me a few questions.<ol><li>Given a function f1, which returns either 0 or 1, both with probability 50%. Make another function f2 such that the probability of returning 0 becomes 1/3 and returning 1 becomes 2/3.<li>Given an array find all the pairs in the array where their absolute difference equals k.<li>Given the arrival and departure times of guests in a hotel, find out the time interval where there will be max no of guests and the max no of guests. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-bookings-possible-given-arrival-departure-times/">A similar problem</a>.</li></li></li></ol><p>This round went well, he asked if he had any questions for him, I asked him a few and replied them happily. I asked,<ol><li>How can I improve?<li>What product are you working on?</li></li></ol><p><strong>F2F Interview Round 3</strong><p>Again a friendly interviewer. He asked me to introduce myself and took a look at my resume. He asked me to describe one of my projects. I described my project. He asked how I implemented a certain feature, and I gave him the answer.<p>Then he asked me few questions of which few I had done before, so I told him that I had done that questions before.<ol><li>Given two strings A and B. Count the no of anagrams of smaller string in the larger string.<li>Given a rotated sorted array, search for a given element.</li></li></ol><p>He asked me what were the other subjects I liked from computer science. I replied OS, but he did not ask any questions on OS.<p>This interview went well too. He asked me if I had any questions for him and I again asked the same questions that I asked in the previous round.<p>I was asked to wait outside. Then the HR told me that there are no further rounds for me and I can leave for the hostel. The result came the next morning and I was selected as a Software Engineer. I got a feeling which I had never experienced before. All the hard work paid off finally. The entire process took more than 12 hours.<p>Total 5 students were selected for full-time role and 5 students were selected for the internship.<p><strong>Number 1 tip:\xc2\xa0</strong>Be confident and discuss all approaches before discussing the most optimal approach.<p><strong>Number 2 tip:\xc2\xa0</strong>Keep talking, interviewers will give hints if you go wrong.<p>I would like to thank geeksforgeeks as it was a crucial resource during my preparation.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
