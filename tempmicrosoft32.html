All the rounds were mostly DSA based. Question asked:\xc2\xa0<ol><li>Divide the LinkedList into k segments and print the segments in reverse order. First I gave him the brute force approach and then he told me to optimize the space complexity of the code and finally code the solution. He also asked me to dry run on few test cases. eg:1-2-3-4 k=2 output:3-4-1-2 (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-list-in-groups-of-given-size/</a>)</li></ol><p><strong>Round 3: </strong>After 2 hours I was called for the next round. The interviewer gave me a problem:\xc2\xa0<ol><li>There are n cities and there are roads between the pair of cities. Find if there is a path between the two given cities. This was a simple graph-based question I just needed to find if source and destination lie in the same component or not. He was satisfied with my solution and asked me to code out. Then he extended the problem and told me to find the path if it exists and asked to dry run for few test cases.

Think out loud.<li>Have some good projects on your resume.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
