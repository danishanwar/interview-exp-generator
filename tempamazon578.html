Otherwise, they need the best solution for the given question.<br/>They sat in front of me and assess my code.<br/>Programming language is not a matter. You can use your preferable language. I prefer Python and C programming.<p>Note: They are very clear in this. Don\xe2\x80\x99t use any inbuilt functions. Sometimes, even striking out the code was not allowed.<p><strong>Round 3:</strong><br/>45 \xe2\x80\x93 60 minutes<br/>They ask me 2 programming questions and 3 testing and troubleshooting questions.<br/>As usual, for coding they need only the best solutions.<br/>For testing and troubleshooting, they need at least 30 \xe2\x80\x93 40 test cases and troubleshooting techniques.<br/>For me, He didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to stop until i write 35 for each.<br/>I wrote 35 as minimum and 68 as maximum.<br/>While you writing the solutions, they thoroughly go through your resumes and ask questions from that.<br/>After the third completed, You can ask questions to the HR before you come out from the panel.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong><br/>Round 4:</strong><br/>Hiring Manager round<br/>This round is different from other rounds.<br/>For me, its 1 hour 45 minutes.<br/>But some of my friends have different timings like 15 to 20 minutes and 45 to 60 minutes.<br/>In this round, there are two HRs for me.<br/>They gave their Self intro with awesome communication.
