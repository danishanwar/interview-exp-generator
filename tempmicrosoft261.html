Where difficulty of a word is:<br/>Word is hard if it has 4 consecutive consonants or number of consonants are more than number of vowels else word is easy. Difficulty of sentence is defined as 5*(number of hard words) + 3*(number of easy words).<br/><strong>Solution</strong>: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/calculate-difficulty-sentence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks Link</a><li>\xc2\xa0Linked list is given where a node has x and y value. You have to calculate changes in slope. So if m1 is slope between p1 &amp; p2 and m2 is slope between p2 &amp; p3 then if m1 is not equal to m2 then there is a change in slope. Total number of changes in slope were expected as return value.<li>\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-leaf-nodes-minimum-level/">Find the sum of all nodes that have no child at minimum level.</a> Return -1 if root is NULL<p>Example \xe2\x80\x93<pre>    5\r\n   / \r\n  2   6\r\n /  /\r\n7 3  9 4\r\n/ \r\n8 3\r\n</pre><p><strong>Answer:</strong> 14 (7+3+4)<p>After this round 8 students were selected for direct interview and 22 for group fly round.

I had to implement student and subjects relation. Then asked me to\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/normal-forms-in-dbms/">normalize</a> the schema. He also asked some theory questions from OS and DBMS.<p><strong>Round 4 (Technical Interview):</strong><br/>The Interviewer asked me 3 coding questions and a lot of theory questions from DBMS and OS. Determine if two rectangles overlap or not. If they do, then separate them in a given size of screen. The program should print appropriate message if separation is not possible. He basically wanted a mathematical approach. He also asked all the possible orientation of the rectangles.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-path-sum-in-a-binary-tree/">Maximum Path sum in a Binary Tree</a>. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a proper solution, so he changed the question to find the maximum sum path with or without including root and leaf.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/validity-of-a-given-tic-tac-toe-board-configuration/">Check if given Tic \xe2\x80\x93 Tac- Toe configuration is valid or not</a> . \xc2\xa0He wanted me to handle all the edge cases.</li></li></ol><p>The interviewer helped wherever I got stuck.<p><strong>Round 5 (AA):</strong><p>The interviewer asked me to implement strtok() function.<br/>Then he asked me to implement first reader\xe2\x80\x99s problem. This round was very chill. Interviewer helped me wherever he could. He then asked a few HR questions.<p>After this 3 got selected as FTE\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Overall, the experience was nice.
