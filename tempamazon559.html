You have to write a function to solve this expression and return value of expression.<br/>MCQ questions mostly based on data structures(trees, linklist ,arrays),2 questions from database and some questions from basic concepts (like give output of given program). 2 or 3 questions on aptitude.<p><strong>Technical round 1 ( almost 50 mins ) F2F</strong><br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-numbers-or-number/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given two very large integers and calculate the sum of given integers without using BigInt library in java.</a><br/>I did it by taking input number in form of string and traverse both string from right to left and added integer one by one from right to left.<p>2) Given two arrays and one product.You have to write function to print all pairs(p,q) such that p*q=product and p belong to first array and q belongs to another.<p>He ask me to do it in linear time.I did it using hashing.<br/>Then He asked me some questions about my projects.<p><strong>Technical round 2 (almost 60 to 70 mins) F2F</strong><br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/key-pair/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array and one sum.You have to write method for checking weather any pair exist in array that sums equal to given sum or not.</a><br/>He ask me to solve in linear time.I did it with hashing.<br/>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/special-stack/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">He gave me an stack and ask me to find minimum element in stack at any point of time in O(1) time.</a><br/>I did it using another stack containing current minimum at top of stack. Then he asks me to reduce memory of program.<br/>3) What are the advantages of quick sort over merge sort and advantages of array over link list.<br/>4) He ask me to explain binary search and proof of its complexity(O(log n)).<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>According to me the key for selecting is don\xe2\x80\x99t stop interacting with recruiter at any cost and be loyal with him/her.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
