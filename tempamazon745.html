Find the transition point where 0 changes to 1 effectively.</a><br/>2. Given a binary search tree, make 2 separate trees such that difference between the sum of elements between them is minimum.(After some time he gave me a hint which helped me solve the problem).<p><strong>Round 4:-</strong><br/>Technical Interview<br/>1. Some basic OS related questions<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/special-stack/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Implement a data structure which would perform insertion, deletion, search and randomize operation with minimum time complexity.</a><br/>We discussed a lot of data structures and I settled with a data structure (Hashtable with DLL). But he gave me clues and improvised my solution.<br/>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/queue-using-two-stacks/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Implement a Queue using 2 stacks.</a> Optimise your implementation<p>(They didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to code in this round. They just checked how efficiently I approached it )<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Round 5:-</strong><br/>Technical interview<br/>I think this is the bar raiser round. We are aware of the game show in which a contestant will think of a famous personality and the host will try to find the personality within a finite set of questions. I was asked to design a system which would implement the same. He asked me to write a code to return the first question (like the deciding factor on which the elements will be further partioned) so that I can find the celebritry in minimum no. of questions.<br/>I think they were checking your approach, ideas and patience in this round. Whatever solution I gave he never seemed to be satisfied. Be confident in your approach and don\xe2\x80\x99t ever give up.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
