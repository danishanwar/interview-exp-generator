I had a total of 3 rounds (1 online + 1 group coding + 1 technical Interview). Here is my interview experience for the same.<p><strong>Round 1 (Coding) 90 minutes</strong>: 3 easy implementation problems based on arrays were asked out which I could solve 2 out of 3 which proved to be sufficient to be qualified for the next round.<p><strong>Round 2 (Group Coding) 30 minutes: </strong>All the candidates were given two questions <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiply-large-numbers-represented-as-strings/">Multiply Large Numbers represented as Strings</a> and a standard question related to trees which were supposed to write on paper within 30 minutes. Out of the 150 candidates, 30 candidates were qualified for the next round.<p><strong>Round 3 (Technical Round) 30 minutes: </strong>I was asked about my resume and projects. And one question was asked about tree traversal and the other was <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-strings-are-rotations-of-each-other/">A Program to check if strings are rotations of each other or not</a>.<p>I could not able to give an optimal approach to the problems.<p><strong>Result:</strong> Rejected, I could not get to give the next rounds.\xc2\xa0<p>At the Tech Round I struggled a lot and also my resume didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any exciting projects or achievements to attract, that may be the reason I was not considered for the further rounds.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
