I solved it using simple inorder traversal and have given the required output.<li>The interviewer was very friendly and helped me whenever I got stuck.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3: (Difficulty Level \xe2\x80\x93 Hard): </strong>The interviewer has given a codility link with two problems and asked me to solve them.<ul><li><strong>First Question:\xc2\xa0</strong> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-generate-possible-valid-ip-addresses-given-string/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-generate-possible-valid-ip-addresses-given-string/</a><li><strong>Second Question: </strong>Given 2 cities A and B and given an array of pairs (costA, costB) where costA = cost of moving people to city A and costB = cost of moving people to city B. Write a program to move 2N people into both cities A and B such that N people are in A and N people are in B and the cost is minimum.<br/><strong>Approach</strong>: I sorted the array based on the difference in the cost of both cities. Sorting can be done using a comparator interface in Java.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 4: (Difficulty Level \xe2\x80\x93 Medium): </strong>This round was taken by the project manager.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li>Asked to design a tiny URL system, considering my years of experience, the interviewer has helped me with the basic design problem of getting the requirements and calculating the throughput.<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design-url-shortening-service/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design-url-shortening-service/</a><br/>\xc2\xa0</li></ul><p><strong>Round 5: (Difficulty Level \xe2\x80\x93 Hard): </strong>This round was taken by Software Engineering Manager. Provided a codility link with 1 problem to solve<ul><li><strong>Question: </strong>Given 2 values N, Sprint all combinations of N numbers such that their sum is S.<br/><strong>Example: </strong>Input \xe2\x80\x93 N=2, S=6\xc2\xa0<br/><strong>Output :</strong> [0,6],[1,5],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2],[5,1],[6,0].<li>The problem could have been simple if N = 2, but \xc2\xa0N varies and repetitions are allowed and all combinations are allowed. I solved it using a recursion approach where one number is kept constant and started filling other numbers such that sum equals S.</li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 6: AA round (Difficulty Level \xe2\x80\x93 Medium): </strong>This is the final round called AA (As Appropriate) . The interviewer has given a codility link with 1 problem to solve.<ul><li><strong>Question: </strong>Given an array of 2N numbers, rearrange the array such that even numbers are in even indexes and odd numbers are in odd indexes. No extra space to be used.<li>Solved it using a single traversal, and the interviewer has tested the code against multiple test cases and all corner cases\xc2\xa0</li></li></ul><p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Primary focus in Microsoft is on problem-solving and system design skills. Practicing LeetCode and Microsoft tagged questions on gfg helps a lot.<ul><li>\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microsoft-interview-preparation/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microsoft-interview-preparation/</a></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
