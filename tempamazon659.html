All 4 rounds are conducted by different people from different teams.<p>There are 4 rounds in total.<br/>1st and 2nd are on DS, Algos, PS<br/>3rd is partially coding and partially design round<br/>4th is managerial round.<p>Here are the questions that are asked in each interview:<p><u><strong>1st Round:</strong></u><br/>1. What are the traversals required to serialize and deserialize a binary tree?<br/>And what about for BST?<br/>Given InOrder and Post Order of a binary tree, construct the original tree back. Write the code.<p>2. From a large stream of integers coming continuously, Find the k smallest elements always at any particular time?<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>3. There is a Binary Tree.<br/>Now you have to replace each node\xe2\x80\x99s data with the sum of its left and right child\xe2\x80\x99s data.<br/>But the condition is that:<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You should replace the node\xe2\x80\x99s data with sum, only if the sum &gt; data<br/>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the sum &lt; data, then keep some value on the node and adjust its left and right child\'s accordingly.\nFor eg: node=20, left=4, right = 6. Now sum = 10. Since 20 &gt; 10, you should not replace.<br/>Instead keep the node\xe2\x80\x99s data as it is and replace left data as (20-6)=14.<br/>Now root=20, left = 14, right=6. Now check the condition again from left, till you reach leaf nodes.<p><u><strong>2nd Round:</strong></u><br/>1. Given a set of strings. We are required to merge all these strings into a single string.<br/>You are given with a merge(str1, str2) function, whose cost is sum of lengths of the strings passed.<p>How can you merge the strings, by making the cost as low as possible?<p>Write code of deleteMin, insert, percolateDown operations in Heap.<p>Solution:<br/>Initially sort the strings in ascending order wrt their lengths. Now take out the first two strings and concatenate them.<br/>Keep the resultant string in the sorted strings, wrt its length.<p>Priority Queue will be used to achieve the desired solution here.<p>2. Given a matrix of size m x n. Here m and n are very large, assume like 1 lakh.<br/>You are given a series of submatrix inside this matrix. Find the sum of all elements inside each submatrix.<br/>Submatrix positions are given interms of its: top_left_cell and bottom_right_cell.<p>For eg:<br/>input array: 5 x 6<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6<br/>7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12<br/>13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18<br/>19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24<br/>25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30<p>submatrix positions:<br/>(3, 4), (4, 5)<br/>which is<br/>16, 17<br/>22, 23<p>o/p is: 78<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Since there will be multiple submatrix will be given for your, its not optimum to go element by element for each submatrix. Do some pre-processing, like build another matrix same size as input matrix, which will contain sum of its sub matrix. This way we can calculate the sum in O(1) time.<br/>For the above example, the sum matrix is:<p>1\xc3\x971 1\xc3\x972 1\xc3\x973 1\xc3\x974 1\xc3\x975 1\xc3\x976<br/>2\xc3\x971 2\xc3\x972 2\xc3\x973 2\xc3\x974 2\xc3\x975 2\xc3\x976<br/>3\xc3\x971 3\xc3\x972 3\xc3\x973 3\xc3\x974 3\xc3\x975 3\xc3\x976<br/>4\xc3\x971 4\xc3\x972 4\xc3\x973 4\xc3\x974 4\xc3\x975 4\xc3\x976<br/>5\xc3\x971 5\xc3\x972 5\xc3\x973 5\xc3\x974 5\xc3\x975 5\xc3\x976<p>Now to find the sum of submatrix: (3, 4) and (4, 5)<br/>sum = sum[maxRow, maxCol) \xe2\x80\x93 sum(minRow-1, maxCol) \xe2\x80\x93 sum(maxRow, minCol-1) + sum(minRow-1, minCol-1)<p><u><strong>3rd Round:</strong></u><p>1. Design a newspaper subscribing system for a user.<br/>What are all the systems to be considered as part of this design?<p>2. There is a stream of integers coming. At any particular point of time, you are required to give the first non-repeated element from it.<br/>For eg: 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5<br/>o/p: If I ask you at 2nd position(after 3), the answer is: 2<br/>If I ask you at 5th position(after 1), the answer is: 3<br/>If I ask you at 6th position(after 3), the answer is: \xe2\x80\x9cNo such element\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>If I ask you at 7th position(after 5), the answer is: 5<p>Solution:<pre>\r\nMaintain a LinkedList, with the elements in insertion order\r\nmaintain hashMap with input integer as key and value as:\r\nclass IntValue {\r\n   int count;\r\n   LinkedList headNode;\r\n}\r\n\r\nNow when an element comes, check if the element is present in hashMap.\r\nIf(present in hashMap) {\r\n    if(element count == 1)\r\n         delete the element from linkedList, \r\n          by replacing its data with its next element\'s data;\r\n} else {\r\n    insert the element into hasmap with count as 1\r\n    and insert the element into linked list at then end.\r\n}</pre><p><u><strong>Manager Round:</strong></u><br/>1. Google crawler question.<br/>Given a set of N documents.<br/>Given k strings: {str_1, str_2, \xe2\x80\xa6, str_k)<br/>Now return the document numbers, which contains all the k strings.<p>2. Given an N-ary tree. Mirror the tree.<br/>Give a suitable tree Node structure for this and write code for the same to mirror it.<br/>eg:<pre>\r\ni/p:\r\n\t\t\t\t1\r\n\t\t\t /  /\t|  \\   \\\r\n\t\t\t2  3\t4  5\t6\r\n\t\t       /      / |\r\n\t\t     7        8 9\r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\r\no/p:\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t1\r\n\t\t\t /  /\t|  \\   \\\r\n\t\t\t6  5\t4  3\t2\r\n\t\t\t       / |       \\\r\n\t\t\t       9  8      7</pre><p>I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done well in last two rounds. So I got rejected. But it was a nice experience altogether.<br/>Thanks to geeksforgeeks for hell lot of questions. It takes at least a life time to prepare all the questions present in geeks for geeks, if we go by one question per day.
