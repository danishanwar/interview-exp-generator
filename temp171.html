It consisted of 2 Rounds ( 1 Online Assessment and 1 Technical Interview)<p><strong>Round 1</strong>: Round 1 was an online assessment that consisted of four parts:<ol><li><p><strong>Code Debugging:</strong> 7 questions to be debugged in 20 minutes.(<strong>Difficulty</strong> \xe2\x80\x93 Easy)<li><p><strong>Coding Test:</strong> 2 coding questions to be solved in 70 minutes.<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence-dp-4/">Longest Common Subsequence</a><li>Given a matrix with r rows and c columns, find the maximum score of a path starting at [0, 0] and ending at [r-1, c-1]. The score of a path is the minimum value in that path. For example, the score of the path 8 \xe2\x86\x92 4 \xe2\x86\x92 5 \xe2\x86\x92 9 is 4. Don\xe2\x80\x99t include the first or final entry.

I was one of them.<p><strong>Round 2: </strong>Technical Interview (It was held on 25th of October)<p>First, the interviewer introduced himself and told me to introduce myself. Then he jumped to coding questions as given.<ol><li>There was a family of ants. We need to find if it is a GOOD or BAD family. (Note: A GOOD family is that in which all the interactions between the ants takes place in opposite gender)<pre>\r\n<strong>Input : </strong>3 3 (3 ants, 3 interactions)\r\n           1 2 (1 interacts with 2 and vise versa)\r\n           2 3\r\n           3 1          </pre><p>The interviewer just showed me the questions and didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell anything else, even though I asked him to explain. I have to find the output of the above test case and code accordingly. \xc2\xa0After 10 mins of thinking, I told him that if we can divide the graph into two parts then we can say that the family is GOOD else BAD. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bipartite-graph/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bipartite-graph/</a>)<br/>He asked me to proceed with the code and I wrote the code on the given text editor then he checked it and didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything and moved to the second question.<p>\xc2\xa0<li>The second question was to find the distance between the two farthest nodes in a graph.<br/>I told him the brute force approach, he asked me to optimize my code. I tried to optimize the code, but he told me that we were running out of time and if I have any questions. I asked one question about the scope of Deep Learning on Amazon. And then we left the meeting and the interview was over.<p>\xc2\xa0</p></li></p></p></li></ol><p>The<strong> result</strong> was announced on the very next day. <strong>Among 30 students 10 were selected</strong> for the internship and thankfully<strong> I was one of them.</strong><p>Though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive any acknowledgment from the interviewer neither he explained the question much but I gave him the best answer I could, and I was pretty confident and satisfied with my given answers in the limited time.<p>Will suggest you prepare and give your 100% and leave the rest. All the very best!<p>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
