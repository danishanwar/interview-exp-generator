So much so that you are most probably reading this article using Google Search. And while Machine Learning has long been a part of Google, now it seems that ML is everywhere! From <strong>Google Search</strong> to <strong>Google Photos</strong> to even <strong>Google Translate</strong>, everything uses <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a>.<p>And these are only the more common items! In fact, Google and its parent company Alphabet are heavily invested in <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/01/looking-back-at-googles-research.html" target="_blank">Machine Learning Research</a> in almost all imaginable fields like <strong>Ethical Principles, Quantum Computing, Healthcare, Robotics, Perception</strong>, etc. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google commented that \xe2\x80\x9cMachine learning is a core, transformative way by which we\xe2\x80\x99re rethinking how we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything. We are thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, ads, YouTube, or Play. And we\xe2\x80\x99re in early days, but you will see us apply machine learning in all these areas.\xe2\x80\x9d<p><img alt="How-Does-Google-Use-Machine-Learning" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-349396" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20191009225853/How-Does-Google-Use-Machine-Learning.png" srcset="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20191009225853/How-Does-Google-Use-Machine-Learning.png 1000w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20191009225853/How-Does-Google-Use-Machine-Learning-300x186.png 300w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20191009225853/How-Does-Google-Use-Machine-Learning-768x475.png 768w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20191009225853/How-Does-Google-Use-Machine-Learning-660x409.png 660w"/><p>So it is obvious that Google eventually plans on fully integrating Machine Learning in all its operations. But that futuristic world is still a little far away! For now, let\xe2\x80\x99s see some of the ways in which <strong>Google currently uses Machine Learning</strong> so that we can understand the full scope of its applications in the future.<h3>1. Google Translate</h3><p>Want to translate a text from English to Hindi but don\xe2\x80\x99t know Hindi? Well, <a href="https://translate.google.co.in/" target="_blank">Google Translate</a> is the tool for you! While it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly 100% accurate, it is still a great tool to convert text, images, or even real-time video from one language to another. And in case you wonder how it translates more or less accurately, well Google Translate uses Machine Learning of course!<br/>It uses <strong>Statistical machine translation (SMT)</strong> which is a fancy way of saying that it analyses millions of documents that are already translated from one language to another (English to Hindi in this case) and then looks for the common patterns and basic vocabulary of the language. After that, it picks the most accurate translation possible based on educated guesses that mostly turn out to be correct. For Example: Let\xe2\x80\x99s see how Google Translate translates \xe2\x80\x9cMachine Learning is cool\xe2\x80\x9d into Hindi!!!<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1277761" style="width:1297px"><img alt="Google-Translate" class="size-full wp-image-1277761" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190924175251/Google-Translate.png"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Image Source: Google</p></div><h3>2. Google Photos</h3><p>In case you are a millennial, I am sure you are a selfie addict! And of course, you use <a href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/" target="_blank">Google Photos</a> a lot if you are an Android user as well. And it\xe2\x80\x99s no shock that you do! Google Photos allows you to back up all your photos in a single location even if they were shot from multiple devices and it also offers lots of other cool effects using Machine Learning.<br/>For Example, Google Photos also automatically creates albums of photos taken during a specific period without any input from you. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not all, it can also select the <strong>\xe2\x80\x9cbest photos\xe2\x80\x9d</strong>. And in case you haven\xe2\x80\x99t sorted all your pictures into albums, you can also search for them by typing in names. Suppose you want to find a picture with your dog, type in \xe2\x80\x9cDog\xe2\x80\x9d and you will get all the dog pictures! This is done using <strong>Image Recognition</strong>, wherein Deep Learning is used to sort millions of images on the internet in order to classify them more accurately. So using Deep Learning, the images that are classified as \xe2\x80\x9cDog\xe2\x80\x9d in your Google Photos are displayed.<h3>3. RankBrain</h3><p>Suppose you want to know who is the CEO of Google? And then you want to know who is his wife? But how do you search this on Google? You cannot exactly write the name of Sundar Pichai or his wife since you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it! In this case, you can simply search <strong>\xe2\x80\x9cCEO of google wife\xe2\x80\x9d</strong> on Google and you will get the required results. This is achieved using <strong>RankBrain</strong> in Google Search.<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1277828" style="width:672px"><img alt="RankBrain1" class="size-full wp-image-1277828" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190924180818/RankBrain1.png"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Image Source: Google</p></div><p>RankBrain is basically a <strong>deep neural network</strong> that is helpful in providing the required search results. It is one of the factors in the Google Search algorithm that determines which search pages are displayed. In case there are any unique words or phrases on Google Search (like \xe2\x80\x9cCEO of google wife\xe2\x80\x9d in our case!) then RankBrain makes intelligent guesses to find which search results fit the situation and filter them accordingly. In fact, RankBrain is currently so important that Google says it is its third most important page ranking factor for the results of a search query.<h3>4. Google Assistant</h3><p>Want a little help in organizing your calendar? Want to know the best Italian restaurants near your home? Want to book movie tickets on the go? Well, never fear!!! <a href="https://assistant.google.com/#?modal_active=none" target="_blank">Google Assistant</a> is here to make your life easier! It is basically a personal assistant that is enabled using a combination of <strong>Google Knowledge Graph, Image Recognition, and Natural Language Processing.</strong><p>The Google Assistant is envisioned as a chatbot by Google which can be connected to your phones, TVs, speakers, etc. with the ability to actually have a conversation with you. Here the <strong>Google Knowledge Graph</strong> provides information gathered from various sources while <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> allows the Google Assistant to interact with you and formulate its answers according to your questions.<h3>5. DeepDream</h3><p>We all know that humans dream? Well, what if computers dream as well?!! This is the premise of Google <a href="https://deepdreamgenerator.com/" target="_blank">DeepDream</a> that used convolutional neural networks to find random patterns in various images and amplifies them in different ways. These images can be tweaked in any possible manner using the input data and various parameters so that the results obtained can be funny, weird or even trippy!!!<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1277771" style="width:715px"><img alt="DeepDream" class="size-full wp-image-1277771" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190924175517/DeepDream.png"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Image Source: Google</p></div><p>There are <strong>multiple layers in the neural networks</strong> in DeepDream wherein each layer extracts more and more high-level features from the input image until the final output is produced by the end layer. To demonstrate this, we have an image from Google DeepDream that is a weird hybrid of a woman and lots of gears. All in all, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to just explain the complicated effects of DeepDream so its best that you just try it yourself by uploading any image you want and then just watching the show!<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
