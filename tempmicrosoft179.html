Write correct code for it .

Asked me to write code to construct Trie.<p>3. Asked me question about calculating Bandwidth of network as a application level programmer.<p>BW=data transmitted/time delay(he asked but i didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree and i talked about all the delays and retransmission and stuff involved in time delay than he gave hint about files read/write )<p>so application point of view ::<p>time delay=file read/write time+propagation delay<p>so BW=data transmitted/propagation delay.<p>4. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-9-find-the-fastest-3-horses/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gave me 25 horses problem to which i politely replied that i know it already</a>.<p>5.

Asked me about ubuntu.<li>Why do i wanna join microsoft ?<li>what about technology do u like?</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>SUGGESTIONS :</strong><br/>1. Don\xe2\x80\x99t spend too much time on writing code and being silent throughout . Write half the code, discuss your approach and its cons. They will spare the coding by having a look at even your half written code.<p>2. If u can\xe2\x80\x99t fake that you have already done a question then straight ahead tell the interviewer.<p>3. Discuss things with the interviewer about your ideas and approach, they can\xe2\x80\x99t help u if they don\xe2\x80\x99t know where r u stuck . Also it gives them an impression that u can solve a problem with some other person or u can cooperate (team player).<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
