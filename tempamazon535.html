Technical Rounds also consists of coding. Here, you need to discuss your approach with the interviewer and then code it on paper.<p><strong>1st Technical Round:</strong><br/>General question of Tell My About Yourself. Following this were technical questions mainly coding.<br/>Q1. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/position-of-rightmost-set-bit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find the position of the rightmost set bit.</a><br/>I gave various approaches, firstly dividing by 2. Then they asked for a solution using bit operations. Gave them solution using OR.<br/>Q2. Time complexity of Binary Tree: Searching, Inserting<p><strong>2nd Technical Round:</strong><br/>Again asked Tell My About Yourself. There were 2 coding questions asked.<br/>Q1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Large number sum using Linked List.</a><br/>2 Approaches: Reversing the linked list and then adding or Recursion. Gave both the solutions. Then the question was: In case of a billion digits, which would you prefer? Recursion has a lesser time complexity but, a normal system won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to operate so much on recursion, as there will be a stack overflow. Hence for a billion digits we have to go with reversing the linked list and then adding each digits.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Q2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find an element in a strictly row sorted and column sorted 2 dimensional array without brute force.</a><p>Q3. Questions on Sorting and Searching algorithms complexity.<p>Q4. Questions on Networking<br/>What is BGP(Border Gateway Protocol)?<br/>What is Link State Routing? How does it work?<br/>What is OSPF?<br/>TCP/IP model and OSI model.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
