It consisted of 28 MCQs based on Data structures and algorithms and some output based questions and 2 Coding Questions. Difficulty level for this was Medium.<p>Coding questions asked were:<ol><li>Euler\xe2\x80\x99s Totient Function<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eulers-totient-function/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eulers-totient-function/</a><li>Count Inversions in an Array<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-inversions/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-inversions/</a></li></li></ol><p>I was able to clear this round and received interview call 2 weeks later but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t attend it because of some reason then I was again called for an interview a week later.<p><strong>Round 2:\xc2\xa0</strong>This was a F2F Technical Interview or I\xe2\x80\x99d say more of a problem solving round. Interviewer seemed friendly. She started off by asking about myself, then after giving her introduction and straight away jumped to DS and Algo.<p>I was asked 2 questions \xe2\x80\x93<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Stock Buy Sell to Maximize Profit<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/</a><li>Given a string and a pattern. Find the count of occurrences of pattern as sub sequence in the string(Non \xe2\x80\x93 overlapping).</li></li></ol><p>I was able to solve both the questions. In the end she asked me if I have any questions for her and then told me to wait outside. HR told me that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a Round 2 and was called for round 2 in about half an hour.<p><strong>Round 3:\xc2\xa0</strong>This was again a F2F Technical Interview / problem solving round. He straight away jumped to DS and Algo.<p>I was asked 2 questions \xe2\x80\x93<ol><li>Connect n ropes with minimum cost<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-n-ropes-minimum-cost/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-n-ropes-minimum-cost/</a><br/>I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t directly told to implement this problem but had to figure out from the problem statement that this is the underlying problem.<li>Return the number of steps to reach from a node to another in a directed unweighted graph.<br/>I did it using Level Order Traversal.</li></li></ol><p>I was able to solve both the questions. In the end he asked me if I have any questions for her and then told me to wait outside.<p>\xc2\xa0<p>The thing with these technical interviews is to know the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 thought process behind approaching a problem. They give you a lot of hints if you get stuck somewhere, they ask you to optimize the approach if they know this can be optimized further. After discussing the approach you are asked to write production-ready code on paper.<p><strong>After 10 minute or so HR told me that I\xe2\x80\x99m hired \xf0\x9f\x99\x82</strong><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
