namely General Aptitude (20 minutes, 20 questions), Technical Aptitude (20 minutes, 20 questions), Coding (1 hour, 2 questions), and Written English Test (20 minutes, 1 essay of 150-180 words).\xc2\xa0 Since there was no negative marking, it was advisable to attempt all the questions.\xc2\xa0 In the General and Technical aptitudes taken together, I was able to solve 37 and guessed 3.\xc2\xa0 The questions were easy but lengthy so I had to manage the time accordingly.\xc2\xa0 Before every section, the rubric must be read thoroughly.</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">General aptitude was a melange of questions from logical reasoning, relations, patterns, and sequences.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Technical Aptitude consisted of questions on\xc2\xa0</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/"><span style="font-weight:400">OS</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">,\xc2\xa0</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/"><span style="font-weight:400">DBMS</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">,\xc2\xa0</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/"><span style="font-weight:400">Data Structures</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">,\xc2\xa0</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/"><span style="font-weight:400">Algorithms</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">, and\xc2\xa0</span><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_object_oriented.htm"><span style="font-weight:400">OOP Concepts using C++</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">.\xc2\xa0 The Coding round required the candidate to solve 2 questions, allotted randomly from a set of questions, based on simple algorithmic concepts.\xc2\xa0 Finally, the Written English Test (WET) required the candidate to write an essay on the given topic (again allotted randomly).\xc2\xa0 Care was to be taken that the number of words in the essay strictly lay in the given range.\xc2\xa0 A few topics for WET that I remember were \xe2\x80\x9c</span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Impact and influence of media on the modern society\xe2\x80\x9d </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">and</span><i><span style="font-weight:400"> \xe2\x80\x9cIs CGPA the most important criterion in today\xe2\x80\x99s schools?\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><p><b>Round 2: Technical Round (1 hour)</b><p><span style="font-weight:400">The round started with a brief introduction about myself and then the interviewer started with questions from my CV.\xc2\xa0 I had 2 internships, 2 academic projects, and 2 Web Development Projects.\xc2\xa0 First, he asked me to describe what I had learned in my last internship.\xc2\xa0 Then he randomly picked a WebD project and asked for a brief explanation after which he asked me draw its ER Diagram.\xc2\xa0 After I finished explaining the ER Diagram in detail, he asked me to write a SQL Query based on my ER Diagram.\xc2\xa0 It was a simple join query, which I solved using a nested query and explained how it can also be written using JOIN.</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">Next was a question on the practical application of OOP Concepts \xe2\x80\x93 </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose a grocery store has a discount offer on a certain product but the customers are segregated into different groups based on some criteria such that every person gets a different discount.\xc2\xa0 How will you design a system for this scenario?\xc2\xa0 Assume that a customer may revisit the store and he/she will not re-enter all the customer details after the first visit.\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> Simple \xe2\x80\x93 Connect your object oriented system to a database and use method overloading for the different groups</span><i><span style="font-weight:400">.</span></i><p><span style="font-weight:400">After these questions came the puzzles.\xc2\xa0 The first one was the \xe2\x80\x9c</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-21-3-ants-and-triangle/"><span style="font-weight:400">Three Ants and Triangle Problem</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9c.\xc2\xa0 I was able to solve it in about 2 minutes, after which the panel started making arbitrary puzzles like </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cA family has 3 sisters.\xc2\xa0 1 is playing a piano, 1 is playing chess, and 1 is cooking food.\xc2\xa0 Assuming that all the 3 sisters can do all the three tasks, what is the probability of 2 winners in each case?\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">\xc2\xa0 After I gave a thought on the question for some time, I asked for some additional information to which they said \xe2\x80\x93 </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cThink of the number of participants in each task and you can assume each task to be a competition\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">.\xc2\xa0 Using this hint, I was able to crack the question.\xc2\xa0 Piano can be played by only 1 person at a time, so probability of 2 winners is 0.\xc2\xa0 Chess is played by 2 players at a time and either 1 player wins or the game is drawn, hence the probability of getting 2 winners is again 0.\xc2\xa0 In the task of cooking, all 3 can participate together.\xc2\xa0 Hence the probability of 2 winners in cooking is 2/3.\xc2\xa0 Finally, they asked me questions on File Indexing and the advantages and disadvantages of the different types of indexing and then I was cleared for the next round.</span><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><b>Round 3: Managerial Round (25 \xe2\x80\x93 30 minutes)</b><p><span style="font-weight:400">This round started with the interviewer asking me to describe myself apart from the things mentioned in my CV.\xc2\xa0 Then she threw some scenarios and situations and wanted to assess my approach to those problems, and not the solution in particular.\xc2\xa0 Some of the situations were \xe2\x80\x93 </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cYou are given a project that uses some technology that the entire company is unaware of.\xc2\xa0 You have to finish the project in a day.\xc2\xa0 What will you do to succeed in this task and if you fail how and when will you approach your team leader?\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a dearth of time and resources and you need to make a quick and critical decision.\xc2\xa0 How will you handle this situation?\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a client who is the owner of a big franchise.\xc2\xa0 He decides to give loyalty points to his customers and once a customer\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty points crosses 1000 points, he gets a free ice-cream immediately.\xc2\xa0 Assuming that the customer himself does not go to an ice-cream shop but necessarily has to get an ice-cream, propose a solution for this scenario.\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">\xc2\xa0 Then she asked me to give examples of how I had worked in teams before, whether I had any leadership experience and how did I handle disputes, if any, in a team that I had led.</span><p><b>Round 4: HR Round (1 hour)</b><p><span style="font-weight:400">This round began with the basic questions \xe2\x80\x93 </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you feel that Microsoft should hire you?\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you want to join Microsoft?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> Then he asked me develop an Object Oriented Model of the Indian Judicial System and gave me 5-10 minutes for it.\xc2\xa0 Upon reviewing it, he pointed out some flaws in the model and asked me the solutions to these problems, sometimes giving his views and opinions on the problems as well.\xc2\xa0 Next he asked me what I had done in my most recent internship.\xc2\xa0 I started explaining the Chatbot which I had worked on and then answered a few questions on chatbots.\xc2\xa0 Then he asked me how I kept myself updated with technology and asked me to explain some of the recent developments in technology.\xc2\xa0 I started with Virtual Reality, answering questions like </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it better than TVs and Smartphones?\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">,</span><i><span style="font-weight:400"> \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it a \xe2\x80\x98reality\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, etc. and then proceeded to some recent products by Microsoft like Azure and Microsoft Dynamics.</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">With this round, my interview was over and in the evening I was among the 5 selected candidates out of 71.\xc2\xa0 A piece of advice to all the students: build a strong vocabulary and keep your cool during the interview.</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">This article is contributed by\xc2\xa0</span><a
