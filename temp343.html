This time it was quite different. There were 65 MCQs related to SQL, DBMS, BigData, Hadoop, Java, Python, Aptitude, OS.<p>Some questions had negative marking, some didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Negative marks also varied for different questions.<p>In this round, most sql questions were on joins. BigData and Hadoop questions were very basic(if someone anytime studied bigdata). OS questions were theory based.<p><strong>Round 2: Technical Round Face to Face (~40 minutes.)</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>My interviewer was a chill person. The first question he asked me was \xe2\x80\x98Please tell me something which is not there in your resume?\xe2\x80\x99. I did that. Please make sure you know everything about yourself :p .<p>We discussed about our projects and then he asked two questions.<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Coding. Given a file which has different numbers in each line. Read the file and if a number is divisible by 5 print(\xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99). if it\xe2\x80\x99s divisible by 3 print(\xe2\x80\x98b\xe2\x80\x99). if it\xe2\x80\x99s divisible by 15 print(\xe2\x80\x98c\xe2\x80\x99);<p>It was easy. I used python and wrote the code.<p><strong>Question 2:\xc2\xa0</strong>He gave me three tables and asked to write an sql query to get some data out of the tables. I had to use joins to get the data.<p><strong>Round 3: Technical + HR Face to Face (~50\xc2\xa0 minutes.)</strong><p>He asked about my internships and projects in detail. He then asked me to write some sql queries.<p><strong>Question 1:\xc2\xa0He gave me three parts in question 1 and difficulty level increased in each question. But still, there were basic questions.</strong><p>He helped in the 3rd question a bit.<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Travelling salesman problem. He asked to code. I did it.<p><strong>Question 3: Get the same output as question 1 using Python.</strong><p>Using python libraries is allowed. I did it using pandas. (We can consider tables as csv files).<p>This was my interview experience. It was chill. I got selected too :p .<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
