When he was satisfied by my approach, he asked me to write a recursive function that would do the job if a dictionary is given as an input.<li>Then he gave me a class design. He went on changing his requirements and I was asked to add support for them in my implementation. At first, his requirement was to draw a rectangle and a circle. Then he went on adding requirements and finally it was to draw different specializations (like curved-edges, skewed-edges, dashed-lines) of rectangles, triangles and circle. He gave a constraint that support for a new specialization can be added easily in my design.</li></li></li></ol><p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">2<sup>nd</sup> PI</span></b><ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-platforms/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given, the starting and ending time of different meetings, what is the minimum number of conference rooms that will be enough to accommodate all of them</a>.He asked me to code it.E.g, :<p>I/p : Meeting I \xe2\x80\x93 8:30 \xe2\x80\x93 12:50<p>Meeting II \xe2\x80\x93 10:15 \xe2\x80\x93 11:30<p>Meeting III \xe2\x80\x93 11:45 \xe2\x80\x93 1:30<p>O/p : 2<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/xor-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Implementation of a doubly-linked list using a single pointer.</a> I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer at that time.

If you find a problem that is solved in geeksforgeeks, rather than blindly mugging up the code, read the description properly. Try to understand what is being done and why is it being done. Try to understand each and every line of code. It is na\xc3\xafve to expect common known questions in interviews. But, if you can understand the approach of the codes solved in geeksforgeeks, you can use it to solve a plethora of problems.<li>In an interview, always think out loud. Explain what you are doing and why you are doing it. If you solve a problem within a few minutes without explaining your steps, the interviewer will assume (perhaps not incorrectly), that you have mugged up the code. This creates a very bad impression.<li>Follow proper etiquettes. Shake the interviewer\xe2\x80\x99s hands while entering and while leaving the room. Also, try to ask proper questions to the interviewer when he gives you the chance to do so. These are the small things that set you apart from the other interviewees.<li>Lastly, never be too tensed. Always remember, rejection is a part of life. Luck matters a lot in job interviews. So don\xe2\x80\x99t be disheartened if you are rejected. You can always apply later.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>A very best of luck to all of you for your upcoming interviews.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
