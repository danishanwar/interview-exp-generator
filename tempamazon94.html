The difficulty of these questions was medium and I was able to solve 2 of the coding questions completely.<p><strong>Round 2 (Technical Interview):</strong><p>All the interview rounds were conducted on amazon chime and live code was used to solve the coding question.\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ul><li>The interviewer started with his introduction and asked me the same.<li>We had a short discussion on my projects.<li>Then he gave me a code snippet and asked me to debug the code. I was able to fix the code pretty easily.<li>Then he gave me this question to solve <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/even-numbers-even-index-odd-numbers-odd-index/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/even-numbers-even-index-odd-numbers-odd-index/</a>, I initially gave a naive solution but later was able to give an optimized solution with a hint from the interviewer.<li>The next question was similar to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/</a> but I was asked to maximize loss due to lack of time he asked me the approach instead of the entire code.<li>Few programming languages based questions were asked.<li>A couple of behavioral questions.<li>At last, he asked if I had any questions for him, I asked few relevant questions.</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3 (Technical Interview):</strong><ul><li>The interviewer introduced himself and talked about the work he does then asked me to do the same.<li>He was interested in one of my projects and asked few related questions.<li>Then he gave me two coding questions to solve<li>Similar to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-expression-duplicate-parenthesis-not/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-expression-duplicate-parenthesis-not/</a> but I had to remove the duplicate parenthesis from the string.<li>and <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/</a><li>I asked a couple of relevant questions at the end.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 4 (Technical + Behavioral Interview):</strong><ul><li>The interviewer started with his introduction and asked me the same.<li>A brief discussion on my projects.
