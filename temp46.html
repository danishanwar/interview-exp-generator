The further interviews went like this.<p><strong>Round 1 : ( Algorithms and DSA )\xc2\xa0</strong><ol><li>There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. \xc2\xa0You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1) th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-leaf-nodes-left-right-binary-tree/">Print all the leaves of the binary tree.</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-right-view-binary-tree-2/">Right view of binary tree\xc2\xa0</a></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 2 : ( Problem Solving, CS fundamentals and Coding )</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bottom-view-binary-tree/">Bottom view of binary tree </a>in both BFS and DFS.<li>Given a directory , where files are created , stored \xc2\xa0and deleted as required. You are given each file\xe2\x80\x99s creation time and deletion time. You need to find out the number of total files present at any instant in the directory.</li></li></ol><p><strong>Note: </strong>This is a Greedy problem. It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to the question \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-platforms-required-railwaybus-station/">Minimum Number of Platforms Required for a Railway/Bus Station.</a> A little brainstorming helped me land to the solution. The interviewer was satisfied with the optimal time and space complexity.<p><strong>Round 3: ( Hiring Manager and Technical )</strong><p>The interviewer was the Manager and in this round you should expect questions related to HR , Leadership Principles and coding questions as well.<p>Initially the interviewer asked me for the introduction followed by many situational based questions. They are expecting answers in <strong>STAR Format</strong> <i>( S \xe2\x80\x93 Situation , T \xe2\x80\x93 Task , A \xe2\x80\x93 Action , R \xe2\x80\x93 Result ) </i>which should clearly reflect the 14 Leadership Principles followed by Amazon.<p>Thereafter , some technical questions were asked followed by one designing question.<ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/">Design a LRU cache</a> with optimal code.</li></ul><p><strong>Round 4 : ( Hiring Manager and Technical )</strong><p>The interview was taken by a SDE \xe2\x80\x93 2 \xc2\xa0belonging from a different office of Amazon.<p>I was asked to give my introduction and some situational based questions.Thereafter he asked about my past organizations where I have worked on earlier.<br/>In \xe2\x80\x93 depth details and follow-up questions were asked regarding the projects to test my knowledge.\xc2\xa0<ol><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-n-ropes-minimum-cost/">Connect n ropes with minimum cost.</a> I used Heap to solve it , so heap related questions were asked.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort-for-decreasing-order-using-min-heap/">Algorithm for implementation of Min \xe2\x80\x93 Heap.</a></li></li></ol><p><strong>Takeaway \xf0\x9f\x98\x89</strong><ul><li>For every coding question being asked , write the clean and optimal code with explanations.<li>Approach to questions confidently and slowly.<li>Keep the interview well-communicative.<li>Think loudly and have a \xf0\x9f\x99\x82 on your face. All the best !</li></li></li></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
