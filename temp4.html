The coding questions for Amazon Online Assessment are almost always repeated. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the 2 questions I was given exactly but you might find similar questions here https://algo.monster/problems/amazon_online_assessment_questions. Try to do both of them and answer behavioral questions seriously.<p><strong>Technical Interview 1: </strong>The interviewer started with her introduction and then asked me to give my introduction. Then she directly jumped to coding questions.<ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays/</a>\xc2\xa0<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reduce-the-array-such-that-each-element-appears-at-most-2-times/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reduce-the-array-such-that-each-element-appears-at-most-2-times/</a>\xc2\xa0</li></li></ul><p>For the first question, I was able to come up with a solution but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having the best time and space complexity. Upon being given a hint by the interviewer, I solved it with the best space and time complexity. I was able to solve the second question with the best time and space complexity in one go.<p><strong>Technical Interview 2: </strong>Started the same as round 1, then jumped to coding.<ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-array-number-x-find-pair-array-whose-sum-closest-x/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-sorted-array-number-x-find-pair-array-whose-sum-closest-x/</a></li></li></ul><p>Need to solve both the questions with the best time and space complexity. I was able to do the first one easily but for the second one I started with the two-pointer approach after sorting but he was trying to confuse me I guess so he said this might not work. Since I was not sure as well, so I gave him another approach of binary search for every number. He asked me to code the second approach. He was very helpful while I tried to dry run the second approach. The round lasted for about 1 hour 20mins. In the end, I was asked a behavioral question.\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Tell me about a time when you innovated/invented something?<p><strong>Bar raiser round: </strong>Jumped straight to the coding part.<ul><li>\xc2\xa0<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-combinations-of-balanced-parentheses/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-combinations-of-balanced-parentheses/</a></li></ul><p>I was able to do the above in the first 15 minutes so then he jumped to SQL. A SQL query based on join and count. Discussion on all the scheduling algorithms. What algorithms I would use for something like Cowin. Modified the questions to accommodate FCFS and priority-based scheduling in the Cowin app. Finally was asked a behavioral question. Tell me about a time you took a risk.? Then we discussed the extra-curricular mentioned in my resume.\xc2\xa0<p>In all the rounds I was given the option to ask any questions at the end of the round, so have some questions prepared. Overall the process took more than 2 months. I\xe2\x80\x99m not from CS/IT and my CPI is also not that great. I was not allowed to sit for a few companies because of my CPI but I did have faith in my skills.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Verdict: Selected</strong><p><strong>Tips:</strong><ul><li>DSA is important but a lot of questions are very common and are repeated. Refer to this for a starting point <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-interview-questions/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-interview-questions/</a><li>I was not prepared for the theory part in the last round so prepare for those too.<li>Work on communicating with your interviewer.<li>Be thorough with everything you have mentioned in your resume.<li>Believe in the process when you are working hard, things will work out eventually.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
