But it is always easier to connect the dots looking backwards and now I can say with assurance that this website really deserves all the applause.<p>I was recently interviewed for an internship position at Amazon and had to go through a total of 3 rounds i.e. one online followed by two telephonic rounds.<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Online Round</span></b><br/>As usual the online round had two coding questions and 20 MCQs. This was a pretty easy round and it\xe2\x80\x99s duration was 90 minutes. The round consisted of questions from various domains like Algorithm, Data Structure, Operating System and Aptitude.<p>A few days after appearing in this round, I was informed that I have been qualified for the next round.<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">First Telephonic Round\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</span></b><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol>I had just three days to prepare for this round and truly speaking, it was my first experience of appearing in any such interview.<p>This round lasted for almost 60 minutes. It began with my general introduction followed by a brief discussion on my projects. After this, the interviewer asked me four questions.</p><li><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question 1:</span></b><br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sorted-subsequence-of-size-3/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of numbers find all such triplets that satisfy the given condition.<b>Condition:\xc2\xa0</b>a[i] &lt; a[j] &lt; a[k] where I &lt; j &lt; k.</a><br/>At first go I thought that it was a pretty easy question but slowly the mist started to clear and I realized how tough it was. The interviewer wanted me to solve it in linear time i.e. O(N)<li><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question 2:</span></b><br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/check-mirror-in-n-ary-tree/0">Given two trees check if they are mirror images of each other or not.</a><br/>This was a straight forward question and it took me less than 10 minutes to code it.<li>Now the interviewer wanted to test my understanding of operating systems and asked two fairly direct questions, to which I gave my answer based on my understanding (not bookish definition as I did not remember any of those \xf0\x9f\x98\x89 ).<li><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question 3 &amp; 4:</span></b><br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-operating-system/">What is semaphore</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-process-management-deadlock-introduction/">what do you mean by a deadlock</a>.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>After two days I got a call from the HR informing me I have been selected for the next round. Now it was the time for the last and the decisive round.<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Second Telephonic Round\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</span></b><ol>For this round I had slightly more time than the last, due to the fact that the weekend fell in between.The interviewer was very very cool and helping this time, something which I kept at the last in my list of probable things that can happen during an interview. Duration of this round was around 90 minutes.<p>This time I had to face three technical questions and one general question on Amazon.</p><li><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question 1:</span></b><br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-all-greater-values-to-every-node-in-a-bst/1">Given a BST, replace each node with the sum of the values of all the nodes that are greater than that node.</a> Only constraint being that I was not allowed to use any global or static variable.<br/>Although I panicked a bit and made few mistakes, I got through.<li><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question 2:</span></b><br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/possible-groups/0">Given an array of numbers find the maximum count of duplets and triplets such that there sum is a multiple of three.</a><br/>Number that has appeared once can\xe2\x80\x99t be included anywhere else.<br/>I solved this question using a property of modulus.<li><b><span style="text-decoration:underline">Question 3:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</span></b><br/>Given the stock prices of 10 days find the best possible buy sell pair.<br/>For this question I started with a O(N<sup>2</sup>) solution but then finally managed to reduce it to O(N) solution with constant space complexity.<p>I was also asked few questions on Amazon like what are domains in which Amazon deals.</p></li></li></li></ol><p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
