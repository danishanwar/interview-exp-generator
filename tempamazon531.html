(I gave O(n^2) approach and O(1) auxiliary space).<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-reach-a-given-number/0">Stepping on stairs: A valid move is defined as either a single step or 2 steps</a>. Starting from 1st stair you have to reach nth stair in minimum valid moves. I gave dp approach then rolled down it to Fibonacci formula which can be solved in O(log(n)) time using Matrix Exponentiation.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/stepping-numberswrong-output/0">Stepping numbers</a>: A stepping number is defined as a number in which the absolute difference between the consecutive digits is not greater than 1, A stepping number cannot be a single digit number. You have to find the number of stepping numbers between n1 and n2 where n2 &gt; n1 and n2, n1 &gt; 0. First I gave brute force approach i.e. traverse from n1 to n2 and print i if i is a stepping number. They asked me to optimize it, after a little while I came up with BFS solution, where a node in graph (directed) represents a number and nodes directly connected to it have one more digit appended at the end. Stop when number dequeued from the queue is greater than n2.<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterative-tower-of-hanoi/">Iterative version of Tower of Hanoi.</a> I gave stack version of TOH. Since recursion uses recursion stack. I removed recursion and used stack to imitate recursion instead. They were satisfied with the solution.</li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong><br/>Round 3 (F2F):</strong><ol><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In any point of time print the first non-repeating number in a stream of numbers.</a> It took me quite a while and after little brainstorming I came up with solution using DLL and map.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/delete-a-node-from-bst/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delete a node from BST</a>. I had forgotten how it was done so again I had to think hard, realized that deleted node must be replaced with its inorder successor to maintain the BST property and coded the solution.<li>This was the most exciting round. They seemed happy with my approach.</li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 4 (Design Round):</strong><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Design a Parking Lot.<li>Create queue using stack.<li>Discussion on all the OS scheduling Algorithms.<li>How to implement SRTFS (preemptive SJF).<li>Discussion on Inter Process Communication : Shared Memory and Sockets.<li>Why sockets are preferred over Shared Memory.<li>Where shared memory is stored (in user space or kernel space) ? and why ?</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 5(Hiring Manager Round):</strong><ol><li>General Discussion.<li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/infix-to-postfix/0">Infix to Postfix conversion.</a><li><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence-in-binary-tree/1">Return a maximum length sequence containing consecutive numbers from a binary tree.</a> i.e.<pre>\r\n            90\r\n           /  \\\r\n          1   66\r\n         /      \\            \r\n        2       67\r\n      /   \\    /\r\n     5     4  68\r\n          /    \\\r\n        99      100</pre><p>Consecutive sequence of maximum length: [66, 67, 68] of length 3.</p></li></li></li></ol><p>I had the hunch but was not able to code it at first, so he asked me to do it later then after some discussion, i was given 15 min to complete it and finally in those 15 min it clicked and I managed to do it.<p><strong>Some advice:</strong><ol><li>Practice coding on paper, try to do write clean code without overwriting.<li>Brush up important concepts of OS.<li>They concentrated more upon the thought process to reach the final solution. So think loudly and you will receive hints ;).<li>Keep calm and remain confident.</li></li></li></li></ol><p>Thank you Geeksforgeeks !!!<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
