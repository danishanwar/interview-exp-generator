He also asked me to modify it to return a binary tree that is as close to symmetric as possible.<p>.</p><li><strong>F2F interview II</strong> \xe2\x80\x93 Was first given a simple pattern printing problem \xe2\x80\x93 for example, if 16 is given, to print :<pre>\r\n    16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16\r\n\r\n    if input was 10\r\n\r\n    10 5 0 5 10</pre><p>The challenge was to not declare any variables or use any loops. Gave a simple recursive function that used stack implicitly to print the pattern. He was satisfied.<p>Second problem was, given two sorted arrays, to merge them in linear time and without using extra space, i.e, given an array with enough extra space to hold a second array and a second array, both of them sorted, to merge second into first and return it in O(m+n) time and O(1) space complexity, where m is size of first and n is size of second array.<p>.</p><li><strong>F2F interview III</strong> \xe2\x80\x93 This was partly a HR interview too, where we discussed Microsoft and its services/ work culture / competition.<p>The only problem was given a dictionary of all words, to print all sets of anagrams together, in time linear to the number of words in the dictionary.<p>The interviews were really thought provoking and the interviewers were helpful and friendly. It felt like solving problems as a team and not at all like a test. The interviewers were quite receptive to our questions and patient.</p></p></li></p></p></li></li></p></p></p></p></p></li></p></li></li></ol><p>About 70 people wrote the online MCQ round and about 30 made it to coding round. Some were called for interview directly and some had to go through group fly. Most of the candidates selected were those who went through group fly.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
