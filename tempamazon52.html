Eventually, I got an invite for an Online Assessment in September 2021 for the application I\xe2\x80\x99d applied for in June 2021.<p><strong>Round 1: </strong>Online Assessment<ul><li>There were 2 coding problems followed by an approach with time complexity.<li>The first question was Demolition Robot; I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the second question but I solved using Priority Queue. The first coding solution passed all test cases &amp; the second solution failed for one test case.</li></li></ul><p>After 10 days I got a call and the interview got scheduled for next week.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> F2F Technical Interview<ul><li>I was asked to introduce myself and about my projects. Then we jumped onto coding problems.<li>https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/<li>Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],\xe2\x80\xa6] find the minimum number of meeting rooms required.<li>https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/ \xc2\xa0or https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-numbers-occurrences-given-array/<li>I was asked for time complexity and to optimize the code. There was not enough time left because I took more time for the first problem so he asked me to stop coding and just explain the further code. I asked him for feedback but he said HR will contact you. It\xe2\x80\x99s was my first coding interview so I was nervous and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t perform very well.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p><strong>Round 3:</strong> F2F Technical Interview<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>I had the second coding round on the same day, we had an introduction then jumped onto problems.<ul><li>https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/ or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-sequence-of-words-print-all-anagrams-together/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-sequence-of-words-print-all-anagrams-together/</a><li>After discussion, I was asked to write code.<li>\xc2\xa0https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/ or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/</a><li>After writing coding, I was asked questions on BFS and DFS and time complexity.</li></li></li></li></ul><p>This round went so well &amp; the interviewer was happy with me and immediately after Round 2, I got called for the next round after 30 minutes.<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> F2F Hiring Manager Interview<ul><li>After an introduction, I was asked designing question.<li>Write a program to design vending machine.<li>After getting clarification I was asked to write code.\xc2\xa0<li>There is a stream of numbers containing 0\xe2\x80\x99s and 1\xe2\x80\x99s. Move all 0\xe2\x80\x99s to left and 1\xe2\x80\x99s to right. Note that size is not given.<li>After solving it, I asked what kind of projects does fresher gets.</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>The next day I got the call and the last round got scheduled after 2 days (on Monday).<p><strong>Round 5: </strong>F2F Hiring Manager Interview<ul><li>We had little introduction then I was asked 2 coding problems.<li>https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/ or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/</a><li>I explained and wrote code for the Brute-Force approach then I was asked to optimize it.<li>It was a new problem to be related to covid but a somewhat modified version of rotten oranges. He told me to take care of all the edge cases, I wrote code then he pointed to read the problem again as I\xe2\x80\x99d missed something, then I took some time and modified the code accordingly.</li></li></li></li></ul><p>After 5 days, I got the call saying that I got selected.<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Selected<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
