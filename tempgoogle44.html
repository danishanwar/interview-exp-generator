Here, participants will have the opportunity to develop and grow their programming skills. Meanwhile, the top participants may get the chance to be invited to <strong>Google </strong>for the interview. \xc2\xa0<p><img alt="What-is-Google-Kick-Start-Important-Dates-Eligibility-Contest-Details" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-482660" height="540" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200908225219/What-is-Google-Kick-Start-Important-Dates-Eligibility-Contest-Details.png" srcset="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200908225219/What-is-Google-Kick-Start-Important-Dates-Eligibility-Contest-Details.png 1200w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200908225219/What-is-Google-Kick-Start-Important-Dates-Eligibility-Contest-Details-300x135.png 300w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200908225219/What-is-Google-Kick-Start-Important-Dates-Eligibility-Contest-Details-768x346.png 768w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200908225219/What-is-Google-Kick-Start-Important-Dates-Eligibility-Contest-Details-1024x461.png 1024w, https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200908225219/What-is-Google-Kick-Start-Important-Dates-Eligibility-Contest-Details-660x297.png 660w" width="1200"/><p><i><strong>* The schedule for Google Kick Start can be checked from </strong></i><a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/schedule" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><i><strong>Here</strong></i></a><i><strong>!!*</strong></i><h3 style="text-align:center"><u>Format</u></h3><p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at the Google Kick Start Contest format:\xc2\xa0<ul><li>It consists of several three-hours rounds of algorithmic challenges designed by Google Engineers and held throughout the year at separate times.<li>Each Kick Start Round will be open to all participants and there is no pre-qualification needed as well.<li>You only need to register once on the website and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be set up to compete in any round you\xe2\x80\x99d like.<li>The problem format is similar to most of the coding competitions. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be given the Problem, Input, Output, Constraints, Some Sample test cases, and Explanation.<li>For every problem, there are two Test sets: One with smaller constraints and another with larger constraints.<li>You have to select the programming language, write your code in the code editor, and submit the code.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><h3 style="text-align:center"><u>Preparation</u></h3><p>Google Kick Start mainly focuses on proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms. So, to prepare for it, you have to practice hard and command over the DS &amp; Algorithms concepts. Just remember that practice makes a man perfect!! You can do your practice with <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/archive" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Past Kick Start problems </a>as it will help you to understand the nature of the contest and boost your confidence. Some of the most recommended topics of Data Structures and Algorithms for Google Kick Start are listed below:<ul><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/">Data structures</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/">Dynamic Programming</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/">Greedy Algorithms</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer/">Divide and conquer</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/">Graphs Algorithms</a><li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bits-manipulation-important-tactics/">Bit manipulation</a></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>Furthermore, try to solve Easy-Medium problems on the above topics in a short amount of time. There are a lot of online coding platforms (such as <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a>, Codechef, <a href="https://leetcode.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>, etc.) where you can practice and grow your programming abilities.\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><h3 style="text-align:center"><u>More about Kick Start</u></h3><h4 style="text-align:center">Eligibility</h4><ul><li>Each Contest is void in <strong>Crimea</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>North</strong> <strong>Korea</strong>, <strong>Quebec</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, and where prohibited by law.<li>You cannot participate in a contest if you are under sixteen (16) years old.
