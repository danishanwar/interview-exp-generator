I Love that!!<p>4) State machine questions !! Gaming Questions (Bcoz m a game developer)<p>Questions on garbage Collection, Virtual machine (Bcoz i did project on it)<p>Anyway i love all those part.<p>5) One very nice question, i need to calculate the area for rain drop which will be holded for bar graph(Its basically a very real world problem, i love to do that, even i did mistakes but they guys are really awesome they helped me out to get rid of my problems)<p><strong>5th Round &gt;&gt; FACE TO FACE </strong>(It was Damm Amazing, it went thru 1hr 15 mins)<p>1) I need to write recursion function for a robot which has to move from one location to other location in a grid.<p>In recursion i took time to write the base cases, but finally with some hints i was able to make it.<p>2) I need to code for k-heavy path approach and also need to write its recursion.<p>There also i was continue taking to the interviewer and clearing my doubts and using the hints given by him. Finally i was able to code it and do the recursion also.<p>Every time i need to write the recursion in mathematical form and calculate the Complexity also like we have to do normally for detecting the complexity.<p>I love the mathematical part and coding, its in my blood!!<p>3) Project Question !! Scalable problems !! Dealing with N dimension study and mathematical problems, even covering my whole resume.<p>Finally he was very happy and said to me that you need to think proper then code or design, rest is awesome !!<p><strong>6th Round &gt;&gt; FACE TO FACE</strong> (It was with the Hiring Manager,i guess, it went thru 45mins)<p>1) He asked me about my whole projects and lots of about my resume and my challenges faced till now, it was good to explain all those.<p>2) He asked me to design an approach which will search all the valid combinations of a given string.<p>I have given some approaches like implementing TRIE, and explained the pros and cons for it and also the complexity of it.<p>Then i modified it and explained the Other approach which is better than the above by using HASH MAP and INDEXING with buckets if valid words.<p>We had lots of discussion on it. and Finally he said we are looking for guys like you.<p>Finally i have the offer Letter From Amazon and He asked me for Coffee Or Cold Drink. I Have taken Coffee.<p>NICE EXPERIENCE !! I LOVED ALL THE INTERVIEWS AND ENJOYED A LOT !!<p>Finally a Gold Medalist 2yr Exp. guy who is doing a very nominal job, got a Right place to work which is AMAZON !!<p>Heartly Thanks To GeeksForGeeks Community And Their Coding Stuff Which is available in Site !!<div class="code-block"><div class="code-gutter"><div class="editor-buttons-container"><div class="editor-buttons"><div class="editor-buttons-div" title="Run and Edit"><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_copy code-sidebar-button padding-2px copy-code-button" id="copy-code-button" title="Copy Code"></i><div class="ring-load" id="run-and-edit-loader"></div><p><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_edit_1 padding-2px code-sidebar-button" id="run-and-edit-button" lang="c" title="Edit Code"></i><br/><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_close-editor padding-2px code-sidebar-button close-code-editor-button" id="close-code-editor-button" title="Close Editor"></i><div class="ring-load" id="run-code-loader"></div><p><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_play padding-2px code-sidebar-button" id="run-code-button" lang="c" title="Run Code and See Output"></i><div class="ring-load" id="generate-url-loader"></div><p><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_link padding-2px code-sidebar-button generate-url-and-run-button" id="generate-url-and-run-button" lang="c" title="Run Code and Generate IDE URL"></i><br/><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_dark-toggle padding-2px code-sidebar-button dark-editor-button" title="Dark Mode"></i><br/><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_code padding-2px code-sidebar-button edit-on-ide-button" id="edit-on-ide-button" lang="c" title="Edit on IDE"></i></p></p></p></div></div></div></div><div class="code-container"><div class="syntaxhighlighter nogutter" id="highlighter_902054"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td class="code"><div class="container"><div class="line number1 index0 alt2">\xc2\xa0</div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="code-editor-container"></div></div><div class="code-output-container"><div class="output-block"><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_arrow-right-editor padding-2px code-sidebar-button output-icon" id="output-icon" title="Output"></i><pre class="output-pre"></pre></div><div class="ide-link-div"><i class="gfg-icon gfg-icon_copy padding-2px code-sidebar-button copy-url-button" id="copy-url-button" title="Copy Generated Ide URL"></i><pre id="ide-url"></pre></div></div><p>This article is compiled by Pushpendra Mishra.
