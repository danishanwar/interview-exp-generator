The selection process included a vigorous online test conducted on HackerEarth to test an applicants\xe2\x80\x99 basic understanding of fundamental computer science basics and his/her ability to code in C++/Java.\xc2\xa0<p>Initially there was a seminar by Amazon where they explained their history and what to expect from ACMS after which 1.5 hours selection test took place. The basic concepts covered in the test were:-\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Computer Networks: </strong>The OSI model, different types of delays (propagation delay and transmission delay)\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Computer Architecture: </strong>8085 processor\xe2\x80\x99s architecture and timing diagrams\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong>Pointers in C++: </strong>concepts of pointer to a pointer, function pass by values versus pass by reference.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Linked List: </strong>deletion operation and addition operation performed on a link list\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Data structures: </strong>searching in binary search tree\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Time complexity: </strong>different ways to compute time complexity, average and worst time complexity of different types of searching and sorting algorithms (in my case they asked for the difference of average and worst time complexity of quick sort)\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Object oriented Programming: </strong>concepts of inheritance, virtual classes and functions, polymorphism in functions, difference between oops and procedure oriented programming\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Logical thinking: </strong>basic mathematic problems to test the logical ability of a candidate\xc2\xa0<p>All the questions were multiple choice questions. 1 point was awarded for correct answers and no points for wrong answers.\xc2\xa0<p>Also there were two programming questions. Programming language could be C, C++ or JAVA. The questions were:-\xc2\xa0<br/><strong>Question 1: </strong>Given two arrays: ARR1 with n elements, ARR2 with m elements and three number D, A and B.\xc2\xa0<br/>the task is to count the total no of ways such that any element in ARR1 can be converted into any element in ARR2 by performing the following operations: you have to subtract D from the element from ARR1 and after that you can subtract or add numbers A and B any number of times. This question was worth 20 points.\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Question 2: </strong>The question and the solution of this problem can be found at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-steps-to-reach-any-of-the-boundary-edges-of-a-matrix/. This question was worth 30 points.\xc2\xa0<p>The selection criteria was that top 10% percentile of the students would be selected. Over 180 students participated in this drive.\xc2\xa0<br/>Verdict: I got selected along with 10 other female students from my college.<br/>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
