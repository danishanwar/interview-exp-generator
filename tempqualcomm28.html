The key to clear is to manage the time and mark only the questions you know (as each question had 0.25 negative marks).</span><p>\xc2\xa0<p><b>Round 2: Technical Interview 1:</b><p><span style="font-weight:400">? He asked me to introduce myself and asked why did I leave job and took admission in M. Tech.</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">? He started asking the third project which I had mentioned in the resume which was related to GPU. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t go in depth of the project and it looked like he just wanted to know if I recall the project :P.</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">? He then asked me, if I am comfortable with C++. I said yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty comfortable.</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">? He asked to explain the concept of VTable. He expected me to know where it is used and how is it implemented. I started explaining him the dynamic polymorphism through virtual function and explained how Vtable and the virtual functions are mapped and also I explained him about vptr concepts used.\xc2\xa0</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">https://pabloariasal.github.io/2017/06/10/understanding-virtual-tables/</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">? He then asked me to write a singleton class. I explained to him the concept but he insisted me to write a class for the same. I was able to answer it by using static bool variable. Although it was not perfect, he seemed okay with the implementation.</span><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern/"><span style="font-weight:400">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern/</span></a><p><span style="font-weight:400">?

For others it went anywhere from 25-60mins.</span><p>\xc2\xa0<p><b>Round 3: Technical Interview 2</b><p><span style="font-weight:400">? This round was very easy for me. As I had computer architecture in resume, he asked me to explain how CPUs work. I wrote the cpu architecture diagram and explained each component. He expected me to explain instruction execution cycle in detail(stages, addressing modes etc., ). He asked if ARM uses the same pipeline stages and difference between RISC and CISC.\xc2\xa0</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">? Explain the role of MMU.</span><p><span style="font-weight:400">?
