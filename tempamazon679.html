Now , people are coming into a stadium wearing t-shirts of any of these colors. Write an algorithm to find the first person to come in, to have worn an unique color.<br/>The question wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear to me at first, so after a few examples , got what he was trying to ask.<br/>For eg. Suppose we have colors R G B<br/>and the stream of people are as,<br/>G R B G G G G<br/>the output should be R.<p>Hope this helps some people.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
