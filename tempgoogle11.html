In the 3rd week of October directly received the mail for an interview for AE Intern 2022.<p>Post which I have undergone 2 technical rounds of 45 mins each.<p><strong>Round 1(Based on DSA): </strong>In my first round of interview after a small introduction, I was asked a question of binary search.\xc2\xa0<br/><i>Find the index of the first 1 in a sorted array of 1 and 0, given that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the length of an array or can say the array is infinite</i>.<p>I was able to explain the complete optimized approach in around 20 minutes, to which the interviewer was happy and satisfied. In the last 20 minutes, I was able to code it perfectly and then we discussed some edge cases. After around 3-4 hours, I received the mail for the next round.<p><strong>Round 2(Low-Level Design): </strong>The interviewer asked me to design Splitwise (Splitwise is a free tool for friends and roommates to track bills and other shared expenses so that everyone gets paid back.)<ul><li>The interview took more than 1 hour, and in the end, I was able to somehow solve the problem statement but with not much confidence.<li>After 2 days, received the expected mail of not getting selected.</li></li></ul><p>Thank You<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
