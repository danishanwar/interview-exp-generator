Given a string which has only \xe2\x80\x98(\xe2\x80\x98, \xe2\x80\x98)\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98[\xe2\x80\x98, \xe2\x80\x98]\xe2\x80\x99, and \xe2\x80\x98?\xe2\x80\x99, Determine numbers of ways by which string can be split into two substrings such that characters in both substrings can form a balanced string. You can replace the question mark with any other 4 characters.<pre>Input - "[(??][??["\nOutput - 2</pre><p>2. Given an array that has the amount of rainfall for ith day and an integer k, return indexes(start from 1) of days which are ideal for camping. A day is said to be ideal if the rainfall is in decreasing order prior to considered day and then in increasing order following k days from considered day.<pre>Input - day = [3,2,2,2,3,4], k = 2\nOutput - [3, 4]</pre><p>I got a call after a week to schedule the first 3 rounds.
