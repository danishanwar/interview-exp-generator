All those who solved 2 questions out of 3 were selected for the next round.<p><strong>Round 2: </strong>We had personal Interview in the second round, it started with my introduction and a brief discussion about my projects. Then the interviewer asked me two programming questions that I had to solve on paper. In the first question, I had to tell if a given linked list is a palindrome using O(1) space. I had to write the whole code, and they were checking for corner cases as well. In the second question, they gave me a matrix of 0s and 1s, and if a cell had zero then I was supposed to make the entire row and column as zero. I solved it in O(mn) time and O(1) space. Although I first told my brute force approach, after that I arrived at O(mn) but using O(n+m) space, and then I tried to reduce the space complexity to O(1). The interviewer was impressed by my approach.<p><strong>Round 3: </strong>It was another personal interview, here I was again asked a technical question. The interviewer gave me a use case, which came down to finding k smallest element in an array, it could be done by using a heap in O(nlogn). But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to answer this question, I gave him my brute force approach only. So I was rejected after this round.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
