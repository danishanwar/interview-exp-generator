MCQs were mostly on data structures, C/C++ outputs, and 3 aptitude questions.<br/><strong>The two coding questions were:</strong><ol><li>Given a string input in the format \xe2\x80\x9cnum1+num2=num3\xe2\x80\x9d. One of the numbers will be given as \xe2\x80\x98X\xe2\x80\x99 (eg: \xe2\x80\x9c5+X=9\xe2\x80\x9d). Return the value of X.<li>Given a string input in the format \xe2\x80\x9car ar2\xe2\x80\x9d (eg: \xe2\x80\x9c9 27\xe2\x80\x9d) which are 2nd and 3rd numbers in Geometric progression. Given n, return nth value of that Geometric progression.</li></li></ol><p>There were around 80 people waiting for an interview from 4 different colleges.<p><strong>Technical round 1:</strong><br/>The interviewer started by asking about the projects I had done. I explained the recent project I did. He then started asking questions about implementations of some things in my projects. I was asked to write database schema, queries that I used in my web application. I used the firebase database in my android application. He asked a few questions about the storage and retrieval of data in firebase and also the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases and about which one\xe2\x80\x99s the most preferred. I answered them.<br/>He then asked a few questions about cache memory in web browsers and also to write the code in my C compiler project. The questions about my projects went on for 45mins.<br/>Then I was given a simple coding question.<ul><li>Find the missing number in an array where the numbers are consecutive and but in an unsorted manner.</li></ul><p>I explained my two approaches. He then asked me to write the code for that (You are free to write code in any language unless the interviewer mentions otherwise).<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>After the first technical round around 30 people were shortlisted for technical round 2.<p><strong>Technical round 2:</strong><br/>This was completely coding round. He asked optimal solutions for all the questions and write the code.<p><strong>The questions were:</strong><ol><li>Find the intersection point of 2 linked lists.<li>Print right view of the binary tree.<li>Given a lake starting at 0, ending at 1 and list of drops in the pairs (x, r) where x is the point that the drop falls on the lake and r is the radius of the ripple caused in the lake due to that drop. Find the minimum number of drops required to cover the entire lake with ripples.</li></li></li></ol><p>The interviewers in Amazon are really chilled out and you can freely interact with them. They\xe2\x80\x99ll even help you if you get stuck anywhere in answering their questions.<br/>After the interviews were done, 4 were selected for SDE role (fortunately I was one of them), 3 for Data Engineer role and 8 for Support Engineer role, out of the 80 that attended the interviews.<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
