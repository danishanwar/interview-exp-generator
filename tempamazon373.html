He asked me to tell about myself wrt to coding. I told about my encounters with coding my projects and research projects.<br/>He asked me whether I\xe2\x80\x99m good with Theory of Computation I said I\xe2\x80\x99m not confident sir<br/>The same he asked me for JAVA and replied the same answer I was not happy with this but I had decided to tell the truth no matter<br/>He then asked about OOP I said sir I can try and he asked about Virtual Memory<br/>I was able to answer the question and explain the concept<br/>The next question was to write a code to traverse a binary tree in alternate even level order traversal<br/>If a tree has levels starting from 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on print the even levels<br/>I.e. print 0th level, 2nd level and so on<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-the-levels-with-odd-and-even-number-of-nodes-in-it-set-2/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-the-levels-with-odd-and-even-number-of-nodes-in-it-set-2/</a><br/>I requested for some time and after 5 mins I thought about using zigzag level order traversal by using a proposed solution<br/>We will traverse the tree in a zig zag manner and store the levels in hash table<br/>And at the end we print even level entries.<br/>He was satisfied with the answer and said instead of using two queues use only single queue<br/>He helped me in devising a solution and we got an approach.<br/>I was not asked to write the code for it.<br/>And that\xe2\x80\x99s it the second interview was also done<p>After 18 hours TPO mailed and I was selected for the Amazon Internship for SDE 1 position along with 6 others from my college VJTI<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
