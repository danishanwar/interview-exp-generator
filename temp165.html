(Cakewalk)<li><strong>Work Style assessment(25 mins): </strong>Questions based on Amazon leadership principles<li><strong>Coding(70 mins): </strong>2 coding questions<ul><li>Count unique pairs in an array that sum to a given target: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-pairs-with-given-sum/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-pairs-with-given-sum/</a><li>Find if tree S is a subtree of another tree</li></li></ul><li><strong>Logical ability(35 mins): </strong>MCQ based aptitude questions</li></li></li></li></ol><p>I was able to solve both the coding questions. 25 students were shortlisted for further rounds.<p><strong>Round 2: </strong>Interview was held on Amazon Chime and LiveCode. The interviewer introduced himself and asked me for the same. After that, 2 coding questions were asked.<ol><li>Implement a LIFO data structure that has the following operations: Push, Pop, GetMiddle, DeleteMiddle.<br/>I discussed the brute force approach using array along with the time complexities of all functions. Then, he told me to improve the time complexity of DeleteMiddle function. So, I told an approach to use HashMap. The interviewer said to make my own hashmap instead of relying on language. I was not able to come up with a solution. I was asked to code.<li>Pattern-based question:<pre>1\r\n11\r\n21\r\n1211\r\n111221\r\n\r\n</pre><p>I was not able to recognize the pattern.\xc2\xa0<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div></p></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round 3: </strong>Interview was held on the same platform. I introduced myself. 3 coding questions were asked in this round.<ol><li>Given an integer array, find all the numbers which don\xe2\x80\x99t have a greater element on its right.<br/>I explained brute force solution and time complexity(TC: O(n^2), SC: O(1)). The interviewer asked to improve time complexity. I told an O(n) TC solution with O(n) space. We moved on to the next question. I coded the solution.<li>Given an array of stock prices, perform 2 queries.<ul><li>Change the value of the stock at ith index<li>Find minimum stock price within a given range<br/>I told brute force solution with O(1) and O(n) TC respectively. I was not able to tell the optimal solution for the second query.</li></li></ul><li>HOD of your college is supposed to give gifts to students.<br/>Input Parameters: n(number of students), List of edges represting friends, k(cost of a gift)<br/>If HOD gives gifts to student A, he will also have to give gifts to all the students whom A considers as his/her friend. If A considers B as his/her friend, it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary that B considers A as his/her friend. Find the minimum cost HOD will have to spend.<br/>For example, if A\xe2\x80\x99s friend is B and B\xe2\x80\x99s friend is C, 3 gifts have to be given.<br/>I told a solution based on DFS. I was asked to code. After explaining the code, he said there\xe2\x80\x99s also an optimal approach. But, we were running out of time. So, he asked if I had any questions.</li></li></li></ol><p>5 students were selected.<p><strong>Verdict: Rejected</strong><div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
