Interview process started with an online coding round followed by 4 face to face interviews. All interview rounds started with brief introduction about me.<p><strong>Online Round :</strong><br/>A hackerank contest with 22 questions consisting of 2 coding problems and 20 MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s on C, OS, DBMS, Networking.<br/>Coding Questions :<br/>1. Given a 2d array with only two elements \xe2\x80\x98#\xe2\x80\x99 &amp; \xe2\x80\x98.\xe2\x80\x99 . \xe2\x80\x98#\xe2\x80\x99 represents cherry and \xe2\x80\x98.\xe2\x80\x99 represents nothing. Can you divide the array into 2 halves with equal cherries. You can only make a single cut either horizontally or vertically.<p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sliding Window of size k . Find max in each window.</a><br/>No need of optimization, brute force was accepted.<p><strong>F2F 1 (30 minutes , Director + Technical)</strong><p>1.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/spirally-traversing-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You have a 2-d matrix , you have to print matrix in Spiral Order Form.</a> Production code was required.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2. What is the most funniest and craziest data structure you have ever used.<p>I said Segment Trees. He asked me to explain it. Why to use it, explain it through some example, prove its complexity.<p><strong>F2F 2 (40 minutes, Technical )</strong><br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You have a 2-d array (m*n) , where every row and column is sorted in increasing order. You have to return an array which is sorted</a> (basically have to sort given 2d array)<p>Approach 1- insert all elements in map/set . ( O(mnlog(mn)) ) .<p>Approach 2- insert first element of each row in a heap (same as sort k sorted list of equal length), then call extract-min and insert next element from the required row.<p>Complexity- O(mnlog(m) )<p>Follow up question- what if m&gt;&gt;n ?<p>Solution- Transpose the given matrix and follow the same procedure as above.<p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-path-sum-from-any-node/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a binary tree containing positive and negative values, you have to find maximum sum that passes through parent</a>. ( O(n) solution was required ).<p>Proper code was required for both the questions.<p><strong><br/>F2F -3 (1 hour ,Technical )</strong><br/>Several questions on Operating Systems and Computer Networking.<p>Operating Systems- Difference between multi -tasking, multi-processing and multiprogramming, Virtual Memory, why to use Virtual memory, issues related to virtual memory , paging, segmentation , multithreading, difference between process and thread.<p>Computer Networking- What happens when you type www.amazon.com in Web Browser, how server handle requests, how routing works, difference between HTTP and HTTPS, how TCP works.<p>Coding Question- Given an array, find min element in the range (xi,yi) . Queries can be very large.<p>First i gave brute force approach (0(n) for each query ) and after that I gave a segment Tree solution to him. He told me to prove time and space complexity.<p>Follow up question- What if we delete some element from segment tree. How do you augment your data structure.<p>I said that instead of deleting we can update it to INT_MAX value.<p><strong>F2F-4 (1 hour, Technical)</strong><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/parenthesis-checker/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a string consisting of 3 types of brackets ( \xe2\x80\x98(\xe2\x80\x98, \xe2\x80\x98{\xe2\x80\x98, \xe2\x80\x98[\xe2\x80\x98 ) , there are priorities assigned to each bracket. You have to check if given string is balanced and valid.</a><p>Definition of valid- Higher priority bracket can\xe2\x80\x99t be inside lower priority bracket.<p>I solved it by a single Stack .<p>Follow up question-<p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/valid-substring/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Find the length of longest valid substring which is balanced and valid.</a><p>Then he asked if you have any questions.<p>Interview tips-<p>Interviewers don\xe2\x80\x99t want most optimized solution. They see how you approach a question , Interact with interviewer if you get stuck ,don\xe2\x80\x99t jump directly to code, think loud and be confident.<p>A big thanks to geeksforgeeks and other online judges.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
