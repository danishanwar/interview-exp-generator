Below are the details of my selection process with amazon.<p><strong>Fist Round(Online):</strong><br/>20 MCQ questions and 2 Coding Questions .<br/>Coding Questions :<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/overlapping-intervals/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge overlapping intervals</a>(Very well known repeating problem).<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/modify-linked-list-1/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a singly linked list you have to subtract the value of first node from the last node and so on until you reach the middle node.</a><br/>Eg: Input: 5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1<br/>Output: 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1<p><strong>F2F-1:</strong><br/>1) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sorted-insert-for-circular-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a sorted circular link list and a pointer to random node, now insert a new node. I did it , but i used if and else for some special cases in my code so he asked me to do it without if else for special cases</a> (generic &amp; simple code ).<p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/nodes-at-given-distance-in-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a pointer to node in tree and a root pointer. Print all the nodes which are at a distance k from the given node.</a><br/><strong>F2F-2:</strong><br/>1) He gave me task scheduling problem:<br/>Given a set of modules, some modules depend on previous modules and can only be executed, if the requirements of that module is complete.<pre>\r\nEg: module A depends on module B,C \r\n   module B depends on module C and D\r\n   module C depends on E\r\n   module E depends on D\r\n   module D doesn\'t depend on any other module </pre><p>so he asked me to give a schedule for above modules such that when a module is executed then all requirements of that module are complete.<br/>so answer would be D E C B A<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/consecutive-elements/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a string of letters from alphabet. Remove all pairs(2 consecutive same character) of characters which occur consecutively.And do it recursively on remaining string.</a><pre>\r\nEg given string abcdaadhhhhhzppzl\r\n  then output string should be : abchl </pre><p>Hint: He asked me to use some data structure for it .<p>3) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/connect-nodes-at-same-level/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a binary tree set the sibling pointers</a> . I told him that i already know the question so he said code it .<p>4) He asked me about hashing .<br/>4.1 He asked me about complexity . I told him about O(logn) and O(1) .<br/>4.2 Then he asked me about how do you get O(1). I told him my approach . He said how will you rehash it when required . I told him that i will use extra memory and copy the hash map . Then i Optimized and did it in-place using a Boolean field.<br/>4.3 Then he took this question to OS and asked me to do it using threads .<br/>4.4 Asked me what all problems you will need to take care about this problem while using threads and give solution to it.<p>5) Discussion on my projects<p><strong>F2F-3:</strong><br/>He gave me 3 coding questions :<br/>1) Given a number n find the number of valid permutations of a string formed using characters \xe2\x80\x98(\xe2\x80\x98 and \xe2\x80\x98)\xe2\x80\x99 . A string is valid if it has matching opening and closing parenthesis .<br/>Eg: given n=2 so you can have 2 possible permutations which are valid (()) and ()() .<p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-linked-list-in-groups-of-given-size/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a singly link list reverse every 3 nodes and if nodes are less than 3 then reverse them also.</a><pre>\r\nEg: Input:  1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5-&gt;6-&gt;7-&gt;8\r\n    Output: 3-&gt;2-&gt;1-&gt;6-&gt;5-&gt;4-&gt;8-&gt;7 </pre><p>3) Given a string of letters from alphabet insert frequency of each character in the string.<pre> \r\nEg: Input:  aaabbbccdefgggaaa\r\n    Output: a3b3c2d1e1f1g3a3 </pre><p>Time Complexity Required O(n) Space Complexity Required O(1)<p><strong>Fourth Round (Bar Raiser):</strong><br/>It was a telephonic round with a collabedit screen shared on our laptops.<p>1) Tell me something about yourself .<p>2) He saw that i had given a seminar on cloud computing and sky computing so he started with cloud computing .Then he asked me why didn\xe2\x80\x99t cloud computing exist 15 years ago .<p>3) What do you understand by 32 bit and 64 bit OS ? . He asked for explanations in terms of hardware and software . Then he asked me that will a 16 bit program run on 64 bit OS without any problem . He asked me what can be the reason for problem faced .<p>4) What happens when you type www.amazon.in in your browser ? . He asked me for the set of activities that take place during this time . Then he went into asking how do you get to know the IP address of your ISP . Then after a lot of discussion he was satisfied .<p>5) Some questions about Complexity of a algorithm . Asked me to prove complexity of few sample codes .<p>6) Some questions about storage space of a variable( data segment , stack , heap , BSS ). Some questions about Macro preprocessors and there problems &amp; solutions .<p>7) Some questions about error in sample code given (like returning non compatible pointer type or returning address of a local variable etc )<p>8) In DOS and Linux shell when we press the up arrow we get the recently used commands . He asked me to implement this facility. Then he asked me to do it if memory bound was very tight .<p>9) This was a question to check my analytic skills . We have customers using www.amazon.in for buying phones. Let say we have a user who visits www.amazon.in for buying mobile phone . He selects a mobile then fills his address details and then when he finally goes for payment then he gets to know that this phone is not available . So how can you improve the over all user experience . Then he asked me that will you suggest redirecting the user to some other site if the product is out of stock .<p>10) Some HR Questions like What are your areas of your Weaknesses ? What are you doing to improve on them ?<p>It was an amazing experience. Thanks a lot to GeeksforGeeks for helping me get my dream job \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<p><strong>Suggestions/Tips :</strong><br/>1) Discuss your approach as many times as possible.<br/>2) Don\xe2\x80\x99t start Coding the problem until the interviewer asks you to do it.<br/>3) Tell everything that you are thinking about the problem. They are more interested in knowing how you are approaching the problem.<br/>4) Asks for hints if you are stuck up. They will help you.<br/>5) If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know answer to a question then please say it directly. It will save time for other questions.<br/>6) First be confident about your approach then only code it.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
