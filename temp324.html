Level of coding questions was unexpectedly easy. Everyone had different coding questions. Few which I remember are:<p>1. Inversion count in array<p>2. Postfix evaluation<p>3. Mean median mode in array<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>4. Dice throw puzzle(DP)<p>5.Roots of quadratic equation<p>6.Linear equation in one variable<p>MCQ\xe2\x80\x99s were difficult and required deep knowledge of DSA and C C++.<p>Out of around 550 students 40 were called for interview.<p><strong>Round 2:</strong><p>Interview lasted for 40 minutes and had thorough discussion on 2 questions.<p>1. Locate all the permutations of a string in another string. All corner cases to be dealt with. Complexity should be minimized. Code should be explanatory and clear.<p>2.Count occurrences of an element k in sorted array in (logn). All corner cases to be dealt with. Complexity should be minimized. Code should be explanatory and clear.<p><strong>Round 3:</strong><p>This was a 70 minutes long round and involved exhaustive discussion on\xc2\xa0 SNAKE AND LADDER IMPLEMENTATION\xc2\xa0 from scratch. Minimum number of moves that leads to victory need to be calculated. All possible methods and their complexity need to be explored in deep. Graphs, DP, Backtracking and trees were drilled and relative performance were compared.<p>I got eliminated after this round. \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
