There were four rounds.<p><strong>2 online coding questions + 20 MCQ :</strong><br/>MCQs had 15 questions(not exactly) on OS (to my surprise) , one aptitude(probability) and rest on c/c++<p><strong>2nd Round ( Group Interview / Written round) :</strong><br/>21 were selected for the second round. We had 2 questions.<p>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/anagram/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given two strings, find whether they are anagrams of each other.</a> (too easy).<p>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-a-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a n-ary tree, Convert it into an array and return it. Construct the same n-ary tree from that array again. </a>(DFS is better here as reconstruction is necessary) \xe2\x80\x93<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Push the root to a stack. \xe2\x80\x9cpop the stack.store the value of the root node and the number of children it has in the array.push all the children to a stack from right to left\xe2\x80\x9d.. do this until the stack becomes empty.. the array will have dfs along with the number of children of each node.<p>For reconstruction,pass \xe2\x80\x9ci\xe2\x80\x9d by reference( i is for iterating through the array) take the value at index 0 .. make it has root. increment i. for all the children of the root, recursively call the same function. return root. (I hope this works :P)<p><strong>3rd round (Face to Face):</strong><br/>Only 5 were selected.I was asked only one question and i didnt do well. Find the square root of a number. i answered that this can be done using Babylonian method. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-a-perfect-square/" target="_blank">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-a-perfect-square/</a>) or binary search method.. He asked me to implement Binary Search method. I did a mistake. then he asked me to correct it.. i corrected it. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to impress him much.<p>Remember the floating point arithmetic limitations.. this is where i failed.<p><strong>4th round (Face to Face):</strong><br/>I was called for 4th round. ( Only i had 4th round because of my bad performance in the 3rd round). The interviewer asked a lot of questions. They were easy<p>1<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/index-of-first-1-in-a-sorted-array-of-0s-and-1s/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">.Given an array of 0s and 1s sorted. Find the first occurrence of 1 </a>( Binary Search)<p>2.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/finding-number/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an infinite array of 0s and 1s.(sorted) .Find the first occurrence of 1</a><p>3. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-matrix/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a matrix sorted in ascending order both row and column wise. Search an element</a>. This is O(n+m). He asked me a better solution.. I tried and he helped me a lot..Though i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to deliver.<p>4. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-path-sum/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a tree, print the max sum path from root to leaf</a>.<br/>5.Given a tree,print spirally the column order of a tree.<pre>ex :               1\r\n              /         \\\r\n            2            3\r\n          /   \\        /    \\\r\n        4      5      6      7\r\no/p : 4 2 6 5 1 3 7</pre><p>6. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-stack-using-array/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Implement a stack using array</a>. Implement two stacks using an array. Implement 3 stacks.<p>7. You are given an array . You have to create a stack when the user wants to do so and delete a stack when the user says.You wont be given the number of stacks that will be created.<p>I thank geeksforgeeks for providing an excellent platform to learn new things.
