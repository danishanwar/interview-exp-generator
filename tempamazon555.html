Each round was for 45-50 minutes.<p><strong><br/>1st Round:</strong><br/>In this round the interviewer asked me the below two questions.<br/>1.a) Given a number find the next greater number with the same set of digits.( <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/next-permutation/0">Find next greater number with same set of digits</a> )<br/>I had to write the complete code covering all the edge cases.<br/>Since I had practiced this question, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take much time to code for it.<p>1.b) Given a Binary Tree, convert this to a tree where each node contains the sum of the left and right sub trees in the original tree.( <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/transform-to-sum-tree/1">Convert a given tree to its Sum Tree</a>)<br/>For this question, first I discussed the approach, confirmed the edge cases and then wrote the code using recursion.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong><br/>2nd Round:</strong><br/>This round started with questions from Operating Systems.<br/>The interviewer asked me questions on Process and Threads, Process Scheduling, Mutex and Semaphores and Memory Management.<br/>Some of the questions that were asked:<br/>a) Difference between process and thread.<br/>b) Advantages and disadvantages of using threads.<br/>c) Difference b/w Scheduler and Dispatcher.<br/>d) Name all the process scheduling algos and explain the Round Robin Process Scheduling.<br/>e) At max how many threads can be active at a time in a machine?<br/>f) What is race condition and how do we avoid it?<br/>g) Difference between Semaphores and Mutex?<br/>h) What is secondary memory and why do we use it?<br/>i) What is thrashing?<p>Then he asked me questions on Computer Networks.<br/>a) Explain OSI reference model and write all the layers present in this model along with the protocols used at each layer.<br/>b) Difference between TCP and UDP.<p>Finally he gave me a problem and told me to first discuss the approach with him and then code the same covering all the edge cases.<br/>The problem was as follows:<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-non-repeating-character-in-a-stream/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You are given an infinite stream of numbers, at any instant of time you have to print the earliest non-repeating number.</a><br/>eg: 2 3 4 2 5 6 output 3<br/>2 3 4 2 3 7 8 output 4<br/>I discussed my approach with him, he told me to further increase the efficiency and gave me hints.<br/>With his hints, I came up with the final solution (using Doubly Linked List and HashMap) and wrote the code.<br/>He evaluated it and spotted 3 errors.<p><strong><br/>3rd Round:</strong><br/>In this round the interviewer asked me questions on the Internship project.<br/>He told me to briefly explain the complete project and asked various questions on the same.<p>Then he gave me a coding question and asked me to first explain the approach and then code.<br/>The question was,<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-largest-elements/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You ar given an infinite stream of numbers and an integer k, at any instant of time you have to print the top k elements scanned till that point.</a><br/>I explained the naive approach of using an array of size k and then inserting the elements at proper position thus making sure<br/>that the array always remained sorted. Complexity O(k)<br/>He was not satisfied with this solution and told me to further improve it ie aim for O(log(k)).<br/>I did some brainstorm for a while and then gave the final solution to him using a min heap of size k.<br/>He also asked me to <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/min-heap-implementation/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write down complete code for min heap</a>.<p>The next question was on Caches.<br/>He asked me to tell different page replacement policies.<br/>Then he asked me, \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lru-cache/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How would you implement LRU Cache\xe2\x80\x9d?</a><br/>I told him that it can be implemented using Priority Queue.<br/>Then he cross-questioned me on Priority Queues, its internal implementation and complexities.<br/>He didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask to code for it.<p><strong><br/>4th Round:</strong><br/>The interviewer gave me 45 minutes to solve the below coding problem.<p>You are given an infinite stream of numbers, at any instant of time you have to print the median of the elements scanned till that time.<p>Median of an array here refers to the middle element of the array after sorting.<br/>First I told him that I would maintain a sorted array, thus order of insertion would be O(N) and order of query would be O(1).<br/>He told me to further optimize it.<br/>I thought of using heaps and somehow try to achieve O(log(N)) for both insertion and query, but then he told me that it can be further optimized.<br/>He told me to aim for O(log(N)) and O(1) for insertion and query respectively.<br/>Suddenly I got the idea that I could make use of a minheap and a maxheap to solve the problem.<br/>I discussed my approach with him. He was impressed.<p>Finally I coded the problem.<br/><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/unique-bsts/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">At last he asked me, \xe2\x80\x9cGiven an inorder traversal of a BST, can u build the tree\xe2\x80\x9d? I told him yes. Then he asked me, \xe2\x80\x9cHow many such trees are possible\xe2\x80\x9d?</a><br/>I knew answer to this question, as it was taught in the class.<br/>I told him about Catalan Number.<p>Verdict: 3 selected out of 33 interviewed.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
