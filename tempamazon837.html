Geeksforgeeks helped me lot. I prepared only from Geeksforgeeks.org. I am very thankful to Geeksforgeeks team.<p>Onw online coding test followed by 4 rounds of F2F interviews.<p><strong>Online Coding Test (2 Problems,20 MCQs, 1:30 hours) </strong>From Interviewstreet<br/>All problems had multiple test cases for which the code was validated against.<br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/encrypt-the-string-1/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">from input string we have to print character which occurs maximum number of times.</a><p><strong>Face to face: Round 1(Technical, 1 hour):</strong><br/>1. Given a boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 (or true) then make all the cells of ith row and jth column as 1 (time complexity expected was O(M*N) and space O(1))<br/>Solution: <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/boolean-matrix-problem/0" target="_blank">Boolean Matrix Problem</a><p>2.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-a-binary-tree-in-vertical-order/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Given binary tree, if we draw a line from root then we have to print all nodes on that line.</a><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Code for both questions was required and some other discussion happened..<p><strong>Face to face: Round 2(Technical, 1 hour):</strong><br/>1. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/urlify-a-given-string/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given string we have insert %20 on each space and input string has enough memory to contain output string.</a><br/>(time complexity expected was O(n) and space was O(1).<p>2.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/intersection-point-in-y-shapped-linked-lists/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merge point of linked list.</a><br/>(I told I know this question so he moved ahead..)<br/>3.<a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/full-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given binary search tree in array form and we have to check whether it is fully binary tree or not.</a>.<br/>(I gave O(n^2) solution but He was expecting O(n) solution after some discussion I managed to give answer in O(n) complexity\xe2\x80\xa6)<br/>4. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-largest-elements/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given that integers are read from a data stream. We have to find k maximum elements from that stream.</a>..<br/>(I gave solution of insertion sort,then come to heap)<p>code for all questions required and nice discussion was there\xe2\x80\xa6<br/>He was very impressed with my answers\xe2\x80\xa6<p><strong>Face to face: Round 3(Technical, 1 hour 20 minutes):</strong><p>-He asked me to choose topic on which questions should ask..<br/>I chose OS\xe2\x80\xa6<br/>-some questions on paging and virtual memory.<p>-If we use 8 GB RAM for 32 bit machine what will happen?<br/>It was nice question..<br/>He was very impressed with answer.<br/>-Some discussion on Networking(DHCP and DNS).<br/>-Some discussion on Linker and Loader.<br/>-Some discussion on JAVA.<br/>-Some discussion on DBMS.<p>-one puzzle<br/>A champagne pyramid is a pyramid made of champagne glasses , each of equal capacity say , n. The pyramid begins with one glass at the top level , two glasses at the second level , then three below that and so on up to infinite levels. A level x of the pyramid thus has x no. of champagne glasses.<p>A steady stream of champagne is poured down from the top level,which trickles down to the lower levels. What is the distribution of champagne in the glasses at a given level i.<br/>(I told I know this puzzle then he moved ahead..)<p>-Give a Building with n floor. A person can take 1 step or 2 step to climb. Find the number of ways to reach nth floor. Code was required<p>Interviewer was very happy after that.<p><strong>Face to face: Round 4(Technical, 1 hour 20 minutes):</strong><br/>It was like semi HR round.<br/>1. Why Computer science?<br/>2. <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/finding-number/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given an array of integers which is initially increasing and then decreasing, find the maximum value in the array.</a><br/>3. Modified k heavy path in binary tree problem.<p>In evening they told me result and I got selected in amazon.
