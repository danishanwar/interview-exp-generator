Google has a list of what the user goes searching for and if it finds it relevant to programming,<br/>it gives the user an opportunity to participate in the foo bar challenge.<p>The message reads like this.<p><strong>You are speaking our language.<br/>Up for a challenge!</strong><p>In my case, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go the traditional way. During the ICC matches a few months ago, Google had updated their doodle with a small cricket game with players as ants.<br/>Just out of curiosity, I went on for inspecting the page, when suddenly there was a comment under a \xe2\x80\x98li\xe2\x80\x99 tag.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>\xe2\x80\x9cUp for a challenge. You are invited\xe2\x80\x9d. And there was a link and I opened it and it redirected me to a new page \xe2\x80\x98Foo.bar\xe2\x80\x99<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356223" height="768" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2017-07-28-20.46.16-1.png" width="1366"/><p>Its kind of like a linux console where you get to solve the problems one by one upon opening a new problem directory.<h1>The Challenge</h1><p>The challenge consists of 5 levels consisting of algorithm problems. I won\xe2\x80\x99t share the problems, neither the solutions as it would be unfair.<br/>But it was really a great experience so far.<br/>The first few levels were relatively easy, but as the levels peaked up, the difficulty gained heights.<p>Currently I am on level 4 and just have one more label to go.<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-356224" height="768" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2017-07-28-20.46.27-1.png" width="1366"/><br/>Upon completing level 3 , I had to submit my personal details with a potential recruiter for a future interview.<p>The Google Foobar is presumably still hiring and its needed to submit solution either in Python or Java.<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the future upcomings for this, but to be honest I really enjoyed the challenges.<p>Looking forward to solve more.<p>This article is contributed by <strong>Prateek Chanda</strong>.
