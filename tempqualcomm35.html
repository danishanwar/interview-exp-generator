Again Be quick in this section also.</i>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round \xe2\x80\x93 II</strong>\xc2\xa0<p>This round was very interesting. He asked me to Introduce Myself !\xc2\xa0<p>After that he jumped on the technical section directly.\xc2\xa0<ol><li>He asked me about my Language used in the projects \xe2\x80\x93 C/C++/Java/Python. And then a Programming question \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s/0">Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s</a><li>How to pass an array with the help of pointers. While passing 2d array, why it is necessary to pass number of columns?<li>Size of structure and union (structure padding) \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structure-member-alignment-padding-and-data-packing/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structure-member-alignment-padding-and-data-packing/</a><li>You have to include a file in your program which will contain a generic code for linked list operations using pointers in C? \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generic-linked-list-in-c-2/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generic-linked-list-in-c-2/</a><li>Write a code for memcpy function in C, he wanted a generic code implementation, hence focused on void pointers and typecasting of pointers.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-memcpy/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-memcpy/</a><li>What is Operating system? Tell me about memory management \xe2\x80\x93 Paging, Segmentation? \xe2\x80\x93 Was very happy after this discussion !<li>Write a program to reverse bits of a number, You can not use mod % operator \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-bits/0">Write an Efficient C Program to Reverse Bits of a Number</a><li>Tell me about your projects, he was focusing on my Information retrieval and Foundation of parallel programming projects a lot in the end.<li>Want to ask Ask any question? \xe2\x80\x93 I asked him about his area of interest and in which area he is working now a days in Qualcomm?</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><strong>Round \xe2\x80\x93 III</strong>\xc2\xa0<p>This round was very boring, because Interviewer was not giving any outputs whether I was correct or not. He was asking questions in a sequence.\xc2\xa0<ol><li>Asked me about content of the questions of Round \xe2\x80\x93 II. So that he can ask some different questions in this round.<li>You have 13 group of cards, each group has 4 cards of similar type and has a same number on them, which can be from (1, 2, 3\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa613). What is probability of choosing 3 cards so that number 10 should be on 3<sup>rd</sup> card?<li>Tell me, how to predict a number if it is prime or not, Derive time complexity and space complexity? He asked me various approaches. I knew only 2 methods in O(logn) time complexity \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prime-numbers/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prime-numbers/</a><li>What is the advantage of using function pointers for calling functions instead of calling function directly \xe2\x80\x93 I told him about lambda function in c++11 \xe2\x80\x93 <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-pointer-in-c/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-pointer-in-c/</a><li>Again he asked a math question. You have a grid of m*n size, what are the ways to go from one point to another point in the grid given that i can not go from two restricted points? \xe2\x80\x93 Famous gate puzzle<li>Suddenly he said Thanks! Wait outside.</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><p><i>I answered each and every question. I was very nervous after this round as the interviewer was not </i>responding<i> anything, he was asking questions only. Then </i>i<i> waited for Hr round for 2-3 hours.</i>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Round \xe2\x80\x93 IV</strong>\xc2\xa0<p>HR round, Again he asked the same repeated and boring questions. Please do not prepare for these questions! According to the situation, predict the answer, what the HR wants.\xc2\xa0<ul><li>Introduce yourself.<li>Why qualcomm?<li>What work you will do in qualcomm?<li>Qualcomm Hyderabad or Banglore or Noida?<li>Any questions?</li></li></li></li></li></ul><p>Finally<i> result came at </i>11:00pm<i> and I was in the selected list of students.</i>\xc2\xa0<p><strong>Note \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0</strong><ol><li><i><strong>Be fast in the online test.</strong></i><li><i><strong>Focus on your fundamentals of computer science (Prepare your gate or Btech subjects basics).</strong></i><li><i><strong>Prepare for aptitude also because every section has its own cutoff.</strong></i><li><strong>Prepare for coding questions \xe2\x80\x93 Interviewbit and geeksforgeeks are good platforms.</strong></li></li></li></li></ol><p>Contact (If more queries) \xe2\x80\x93 guliaataptitude@gmail.com<br/>\xc2\xa0<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
