Given two arrays of numbers. The numbers are from 0-9 you have two maximize the first array by using the elements from the second array.<pre>the elements can be used only once.\r\n   e.g. arr1[] = {5, 2, 3, 6, 7};\r\n\tarr2[] = {9, 2, 8, 4, 5};\r\nYou should output the modified arr1 as {9,8,5,6,7}</pre><p>2.Given a matrix of characters and a word.<br/>you have to count the number of occurrences of that word in that matrix. you can move to any of the eight valid directions from current position.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><pre>  e.g.  word="HELLO";\r\n\tmatrix[][5] = { {\'H\',\'E\',\'L\',\'L\',\'O\'},\r\n\t\t      {\'E\',\'H\',\'E\',\'A\',\'B\'},\r\n\t\t      {\'L\',\'L\',\'O\',\'C\',\'D\'}};\r\n\toutput should be : 5\r\nNow after a long one month break, they displayed the results.</pre><p>I was lucky enough to get selected.<br/>All other rounds were taken at Microsoft IDC hydrabad centre.<p><strong>Elimination Round:</strong><p>One Coding question was given to all the students ,You have to code and explain it.<br/>You are given an string as input which represents a path. You have to normalize that path inplace(NO EXTRA SPACE).<pre>\te.g.\r\n\t     input : "\\a\\b\\c\\..\\..\\file.txt"\r\n\t     output: "\\a\\file.txt"</pre><p>Hint: Double dot(..) means you have to skip the previous parent.<p><strong>Interview Round I:</strong><br/>Firstly,Tell me about yourself and some discussion on projects and what i have learnt till now.<p>Coding Question on pen &amp; Paper: You have a Binary tree having numbers&gt;=0 and a numeber N.<br/>Print all downwards paths from any node having the sum of elements equal to N.<br/>I gave a simple recursive algorithm then he ask me to optimize, then after around 10 min i gave him another solution a little bit optimized. He again ask me to optimize more. I tried but can\xe2\x80\x99t do more optimisation ,So he ask me write code and said the main purpose of the interview is to write the correct code.<p><strong>Interview Round II:</strong><br/>The interviewer asked me what i have done in technical till now, and saw my resume for a while, then gave me a question which i have to code and explain.<br/>You have a cuboid (m*n*p) each block of the cuboid is having a metallic ball.<br/>Now we are passing X-ray from front face and getting a bool matrix1 of m*p the elements are set if there is a black spot.(as we are passing X-ray) and another matrix2 of n*p by passing X-ray from right face.<br/>Now you have to print the co-ordinate (i,j,k) where mettallic balls are present.<br/>Is it possible to get the accurate result from given data or you need more data. If you need more data then what data you need ?<p>I explained my approach to him , made a code and asked him to provide me more data ( The m*n matrix ) to get the more accurate result.<p>A Big Thanks to GeeksForGeeks.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
