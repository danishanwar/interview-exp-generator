Write a code to find kth largest element in an array.<br/>Interviewer was interested in the most optimal solution straight away along with writing code for all the heap operations from scratch.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-largestor-smallest-elements-in-an-array/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-largestor-smallest-elements-in-an-array/</a><p>2. Write a code to merge k sorted arrays of size n.<br/>Used the heap approach again and coded.<br/><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-arrays/</a><p>3. Design a parking lot. He had given a ParkingLot class. He asked me to design the object oriented architecture supporting the park() and unpark() apis.<br/>Then, he discussed the working of all other support apis of different classes along with the minimum argument list for calling. The internal algorithms also were optimised at the end.<br/>For your reference, you can take help from the below link:<br/><a href="https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5668639101419520/5692201761767424/5770234338213888">https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5668639101419520/5692201761767424/5770234338213888</a><br/>4. Under which conditions you will use abstract class and when you will use interfaces.<p>5. Any design challenge you faced in your project.<br/><strong><p>Round 2 (Design)</p></strong><br/>1. Design Distributed cache system.<br/>For data coming from the client side, I used the concept of aggregator in between so as to periodically dump that data to the cache side. But data should be sorted while dumping.<br/>So some challenge got introduced that he asked to sort large GB files with 200 mb main memory. Used n way external merge sort. After agreeing to some extent on my approach, he then asked me to write the full code covering all edge cases for the same.<br/>Also, I used the concept of load balancers just before the cache layer. So, the interviewer asked how you actually implement load balancing. I used the concept of consistent hashing to explain the load balancing part which minimises the redistribution of load when a server gets added/removed and also helps in reducing skewed load on any of the cache by using a concept of virtual servers.<br/>Reference video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaRkONvyGr8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaRkONvyGr8</a><div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><strong><br/>Round 3(Design)</strong><br/>1. Design Autocomplete feature of Bing search.<br/>All the discussion on how efficiently trie data structure usage will you do and how will you rank the suggestions and how many suggestions will be output to the user.<br/>How will you shard the trie database and design other supporting system components.<br/>My implementation at the end was something like the link given below:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us0qySiUsGU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us0qySiUsGU</a><p>2. Implement a concurrent mark and sweep garbage collector. I used concept of concurrent hashmap on garbage collector and devised Mark and sweep algorithm accordingly. Then there was discussion on all the concurrency challenges. As I was from Java Background, he asked me this question.<br/><strong><br/>Round 4: (With Director \xe2\x80\x93 Office 365 Web apps Team)</strong><br/>The head was part of Microsoft from last 25 years.<br/>1. Discussion on projects and the project architecture. He asked about what part of my framework I am handling.<br/>Since he was very senior, I started to introduce my current and previous projects from the business perspective first and then moved into the architecture part in detail.<br/>He then stressed on the features I developed in my current project to understand the exact business use cases of the same.<br/>2. My challenges faced on a regular basis and how you resolve them to ensure timely delivery of your product.<br/>3. Then he explained all the challenges and the model of the Web apps they are targeting for their Office 365 product. There is a huge delta from the current scenario of Office 365 as far as deploying on the web as SaaS is concerned.<p>Rounds were done. The director said HR will contact me. Finally, got the offer in some days \xf0\x9f\x99\x82<div class="textBasedMannualAds_2"></div><div class="clear hideIt" id="personalNoteDiv"><div class="personalNoteHeader clear"><span class="noteHeaderText">My Personal Notes</span>\n<span class="hideNotesDivIcon"><i class="material-icons personalNotesIcon">arrow_drop_up</i></span></div><div class="collapsableDivPersonalNotes"><textarea class="personalNoteStyle" id="enteredPersonalNote" maxlength="5000" placeholder="Add your personal notes here!
