I had opted for both Microsoft IT and IDC. The first couple of rounds were online rounds and were hosted on Cocubes.com<p><strong>Round 1</strong><br/>It comprised of 15 MCQ Questions and time allotted was 30 mins. Every student had a unique set of questions which comprised of C,C++ (I/O), Data Structures, Java, and Aptitude. The questions required a decent amount of thinking.<p><strong>Round 2 (Online Coding)</strong><br/>1. You are given a matrix of dimensions m*n where each cell in the matrix can have values 0,1 or 2 which has the following meaning :<br/>0:empty cell<br/>1:cells have fresh oranges<br/>2:cells have rotten oranges<br/>So we have to determine what is the minimum time required so that all the oranges will be rotten. A rotten orange at index [i,j] can rot other fresh orange at indexes [i+1,j] ,[i,j+1] ,[i-1,j] ,[i,j-1]. If it is impossible to rot every orange then simply return -1.<br/>This was to be done without allocating any extra space.<p>2. Connect all leaf nodes of a binary tree to make a LL. (Without allocating any extra space for the linked list).<br/><strong>Now, around 30 students were shortlisted for Microsoft IT and around 40 for IDC. There were some people who got short listed for both. I was lucky enough to sit for both of them.<br/>From here I will write the processes for IDC and IT separately.</strong><p><strong>FOR IT</strong><br/><strong>Round 3(Group Fly Round)</strong><br/>Some people who had a high score in the 1st and 2nd rounds did not have to appear this round. They were promoted for the next rounds.<br/>There were two questions.<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><ol><li>Given a string (Assume that its case insensitive and has no spaces), find the length of the largest palindromic substring.<br/>While the brute force solution would have O(n^2) complexity, with some thinking you can arrive at a O(n^2) solution.<li>Given a string , return the length of the longest substring which comprises of consecutive characters.<br/>Ex: abcxy<br/>Output:<br/>3<br/>abc</li></li></ol><p>Discuss your approach with your mentors and be very clear about it. Write comments on the paper code.<p><strong>Round 4 (Technical PI)</strong><br/>The interviewer was nice and made me feel extremely confident. He went through my resume and asked me a few basic questions on data structures that we use. Also know the efficiency of using each data structure and there pros and cons.<p>He first asked me to write a code to implement the \xe2\x80\x9cEvaluate Function\xe2\x80\x9d of Microsoft Excel. I gave him the solution where we convert the expression from infix to postfix and then evaluate the postfix expression. However, I was aware that this solution would not work for 2 digit number (or results). So I suggested an improvement by taking input as a string and then converting the string into an integer. The interviewer was satisfied with the logic.<p>He then asked me if I knew anything about encryption. Though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a very clear idea but I told him about some ciphers that can be used.<p>I had only one project on my resume. We had a 15 minute discussion of the challenges faced in making it and how it could be further improved.<p>The interview lasted for around 40-45 mins.<p><strong>Round 5 (As Appropriate AA)</strong><br/>Now people who did relatively well in the previous technical round qualified for this.<p>The interviewer was again very warm. Though my CGPA was high, it kept decreasing every semester. He asked me the reason for this.<p>Then we discussed about my experience and work at one of the earlier places that I had interned. And he asked a few other questions like \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Microsoft? \xe2\x80\x9c and \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I can do to improve Microsoft?\xe2\x80\x9d.<p>Just be honest and confident about what you speak. And this round should go smooth.<p><strong>FOR IDC</strong><br/>It followed a very similar structure like the IT interviews. The interviews here focused more on coding and databases. There were two Technical PI rounds instead of one after the group fly round.<p>The question tested the fundamentals and data structures.<p>There was a question on implementing a data structure to store a word along with all of its acronyms from a dictionary such that we can search it efficiently.<p>Thanks to GeeksforGeeks for building such a repository. I have learned a lot from this forum in the last one year. Awesome platform. And I would urge others who gain from this platform to contribute their experiences as well.<p>Cheers.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
