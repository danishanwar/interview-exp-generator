If any one type is in excess, let it come in the end.</a><p>2) <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/transform-to-sum-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a binary tree, change the value of the node by the sum of the values of its children</a>.<p>I completed both the programs, first one passed 7 test cases, second one passed all test cases. I was shortlisted for the interviews<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p><b>1st Round F2F (Technical)</b><p>Asked what was my favorite project among the ones i have mentioned in my resume. Then he asked to explain Project, and then he asked few questions regarding it.<p>He asked 2 questions. One was regarding linked lists. I forgot what those questions were.<p><b>2nd Round F2F (Technical)</b><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/stack-using-two-queues/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stack using 2 queues. </a>I implemented and showed, he was happy.<p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/boolean-matrix-problem/0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Given a matrix. Each cell is either marked with a * or nothing. One cannot go into the cells that are marked by a *. Given 2 points a and b in the matrix, Find out if point b is reachable from point </a>a.<br/>I gave a solution solution, but i had missed marking the cells visited. He pointed out that it will be an infinite recursion. So i said i will mark it visited. He then told me to code it. I did. He was satisfied with it.<p>Robot problem. Dynamic programming. I somehow solved it, he then asked for the code. I wrote it. He tried to understand himself, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to. So i made him understand, he was happy and satisfied with it.<p><b>3rd Round F2F (Technical)</b><p>Questions on OOPs concept. Asked what a singleton class is. I answered, then he asked how can it be implemented in C++. I was weak in the C++ language, so he gave hints. I tried but he was not satisfied with my answer.<p>Then he asked to a question regarding trees. Given a binary tree, you have to connect all the nodes in each level through extra pointers.<br/>I gave an approach using queue. He then asked how to do with constant space. I tried, but i had forgotten the algorithm. He tried giving hints, but i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to solve.<p><b>4th Round F2F (HR + Technical)</b><p>He started off by asking how was the other interviews. Then he asked the typical \xe2\x80\x9cTell me about yourself\xe2\x80\x9d.<p>He asked me little about my favorite project. I selected the same one which i explained in the first interview.<p>Next he asked, Given just a page of a Dictionary. It can be from anywhere, middle, end or start. The dictionary is for a language that one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know. You have to find out the order of the alphabets, which one comes before and which one comes after. I started with an approach using generic tree. He asked me why can\xe2\x80\x99t graph be used. I thought a little and agreed, and started using graph. I explained him the inconsistencies that can occur. Later after few minutes of discussion, he told me, suppose he gives me a graph with letters in place of nodes, and says to find out the order of the alphabets. How would i go about doing it. I mentioned topological sort, but i said i don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the algorithm properly. He gave a little hint, that reminded me, and i solved it.<p>He gave a scenario. Suppose you type \xe2\x80\x9cwww.amazon.com\xe2\x80\x9d and hit Enter. What goes on in the background after that. I gave a detailed explanation with Network layers, routing, CDN, Content Caching. I missed out NAT, so he asked me what it was and how it will be used.<p>Then he gave me a list of list. It had integers. Like the one shown in picture below (in Attachment).<br/><a href="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Amazon_Interview_Experience_Set212-.jpg"><img alt="Office Lens_20150809_175312_processed" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-135195" height="270" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Amazon_Interview_Experience_Set212-.jpg" width="475"/></a><p><a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/flattening-a-linked-list/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">He told me to print 1, 2, 3, 4\xe2\x80\xa6 </a>I did it using loops, But he wanted to optimize it, and said that i can modify the list if i wished. So i thought a little and got the idea. He asked me to write the code. I wrote, he saw and said there was a bug, but he had missed something, i explained him, so he was satisfied with the code.<p>Only 7 people were there till the last round. The interviews were over by 10:40pm. They took 3 hours to come to the final list. They said that we all did very well. At 1:30 night they announced 3 names. I was not selected. All in all it was a good experience, but i was a little sad after the results came out.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
