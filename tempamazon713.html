The amazon is a beautiful forest.\xe2\x80\x9d<div id="AP_G4GR_5"></div><p>Find the minimum distance between \xe2\x80\x98Amazon\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98The\xe2\x80\x99<p><strong>Given:</strong> You are given the position of each word in the paragraph. Meaning, you know that word \xe2\x80\x98Amazon\xe2\x80\x99 occurs at positions 1 and 10, and \xe2\x80\x98The\xe2\x80\x99 occurs at 3 and 9. You do not have to parse the paragraph to gather this info.<p><strong>Sub questions :</strong><br/>*Which data structure will you use to store the given info?<br/>*Compute the minimum distance in the most efficient way.<br/>*Give a working code for the same.<p><u><strong>Question 2</strong></u><br/><strong>Problem statement:</strong> <a href="https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In a binary tree, a chain can be defined as sum of length of the left node series, right node series, and 1. Find the length of longest chain in the tree.</a><br/><strong>Example:</strong> Refer to the image given below \xe2\x80\x93<p>Chain length of node 1 = 3 + 2 + 1 = {count of 3 corresponds to node 2 , node 4, node 8 ; count of 2 corresponds to node 3, node 7 ; 1 corresponds to node 1 itself}<br/>Similarly, chain length of node 2 = 2 + 1 + 1<br/>The max chain length here is of node 1 which is 5. So, the output should be 5.<br/><img alt="tree" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-132631" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/tree-7.png"/><p><strong>Sub questions:</strong><br/>* Provide a solution, optimize it, give a working code or pseudo code or an algorithm for the same.<h2>Second round</h2><p><u><strong>Question 1:</strong></u> Given two valid dictionary words, find the minimum number of steps required to transform first word to second word. Following are the transformation rules \xe2\x80\x93<p>1. You can, in a single step, change a single letter in the word.<br/>2. Each transition should result in a valid word. Assume you have been provided a helper function boolean isValid (String word) which tells you if a word is valid or not.<br/>3. This must be done with minimum transitions.<p><strong>Example:</strong> Transform CAT to TOY. One of the several possible transformations is CAT -&gt; CAR -&gt; TAR -&gt; TOR -&gt; TOY<p><u><strong>Question 2 :</strong></u> Assume you have been given a binary tree such that the angle between horizontal and the line joining node to it\xe2\x80\x99s left child (or right child) is 45 degree. This essentially means node 5 and 6 in the tree figure above collapse into a single node. A vertical for a tree is defined as shown in the figure below. Given a binary tree of the kind defined above, find the number of verticals that can be drawn.<p><strong>Example:</strong> Refer to the diagram below to get an idea on verticals.<br/><img alt="vertical-tree" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-132632" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/vertical.png"/><br/>?<br/><strong>Sub questions:</strong><br/>* Provide a solution and also provide a working code for the same.<p>If you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org.
